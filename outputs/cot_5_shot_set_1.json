In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14. Therefore, the correct answer is B) TTP<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: The most indicative test for prostate cancer is: Options: A) A thorough digital rectal examination B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) C) Excretory urography D) Prostate-specific antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.\n\nOption A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.\nOption B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.

Options: A) Myocyte hypercontracture: B) Leucocyte aggregation C) Free radicals D) Complement activation<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe \"no-reflow\" phenomenon is a condition where there is a lack of perfusion of the myocardium despite successful reperfusion of the coronary artery. This can occur due to various mechanisms, including:\n\n* Leukocyte aggregation (Option B): Leukocytes can aggregate in the microvasculature, causing obstruction of blood flow and reducing perfusion.\n* Platelet activation and aggregation (not mentioned in the options): Platelets can also aggregate and form thrombi, reducing blood flow.\n* Microvascular spasm (not mentioned in the options): Constriction of the microvasculature can also contribute to the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon.\n* Endothelial dysfunction (not mentioned in the options): Endothelial dysfunction can lead to impaired vasodilation and reduced perfusion.\n\nMyocyte hypercontracture (Option A) is a phenomenon that occurs in the setting of reperfusion, where the myocytes contract excessively, leading to increased oxygen demand and potentially worsening ischemia. While it can contribute to reperfusion injury, it is not the primary cause of the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon.\n\nFree radicals (Option C) can contribute to reperfusion injury, but they are not the primary cause of the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon.\n\nComplement activation (Option D) can contribute to reperfusion injury, but it is not the primary cause of the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Leukocyte aggregation.<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14. Therefore, the correct answer is B) TTP<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: The most indicative test for prostate cancer is: Options: A) A thorough digital rectal examination B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) C) Excretory urography D) Prostate-specific antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.\n\nOption A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.\nOption B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.

The prognosis of neuroblastoma is influenced by several factors, including:\n\n* Age at diagnosis: Children under 1 year old have a better prognosis than those over 1 year old.\n* Stage: The stage of the disease at diagnosis is a strong predictor of outcome. Patients with localized disease (stage 1) have a better prognosis than those with advanced disease (stage 3 or 4).\n* Histology: The histology of the tumor is also important. Patients with favorable histology (e.g., Shimada or Schwannian stroma-poor) have a better prognosis than those with unfavorable histology (e.g., neuroblastoma with ganglioneuroblastoma or undifferentiated neuroblastoma).\n\nAmong the options, the following are considered poor prognostic factors:\n\n* N-myc amplification: Amplification of the N-myc gene is associated with a poor prognosis.\n* Chromosome 1p deletion: Deletion of chromosome 1p is associated with a poor prognosis.\n\nThe following are considered good prognostic factors:\n\n* Diploidy: Neuroblastomas with diploid DNA content have a better prognosis than those with aneuploid DNA content.\n* Trk A expression: Expression of the Trk A receptor is associated with a better prognosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) N-myc amplification.<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

The mechanism of ARF is thought to be an autoimmune response, where the immune system mistakenly targets the host's own tissues, particularly the heart, joints, and skin, due to cross-reactivity with antigens shared between the streptococcal M protein and host proteins.\n\nThe streptococcal M protein is a surface protein that is highly conserved among different strains of GABHS. During a streptococcal infection, the immune system produces antibodies against the M protein, which can then cross-react with similar proteins in the host's tissues, leading to an autoimmune response. This cross-reactivity is thought to be the primary mechanism underlying the development of ARF.\n\nThe other options are not accurate mechanisms of ARF:\n\n* Option B: Innocent bystander effect is a phenomenon where an immune response is triggered by an antigen that is not the primary target of the immune response. While this can occur in some cases, it is not the primary mechanism of ARF.\n* Option C: Streptococci do not secrete toxins that cause ARF.\n* Option D: While pyrogenic cytokines can contribute to the inflammatory response in ARF, they are not the primary mechanism of the disease.<|eot_id|>",

In the absence of functional MPO, neutrophils are unable to produce hydrogen peroxide and halide ions, which are necessary for the production of hypohalous acids, such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl), that are toxic to bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) An inability to produce hydroxyhalide radicals. The patient's neutrophils are unable to produce the reactive oxygen species (ROS) necessary for killing bacteria, making them more susceptible to infections.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA) Defective neutrophil degranulation is a different condition, characterized by impaired release of granules from neutrophils, which can affect their antimicrobial activity.\n\nB) Defective production of prostaglandins is not related to MPO deficiency.\n\nD) Decreased oxygen consumption after phagocytosis is not a known consequence of MPO deficiency.<|eot_id|>",

Options: A) AD B) AR C) X linked dominant D) X linked recessive<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) X-linked recessive.\n\nX-linked recessive disorders are more common in boys because they inherit the mutated gene from their mother, who is a carrier of the disease. Since the gene is located on the X chromosome, boys have only one X chromosome, so they are more likely to express the disease if they inherit the mutated gene. Girls, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so they are more likely to be carriers of the disease, but less likely to express it themselves.\n\nExamples of X-linked recessive disorders that affect boys more frequently include:\n\n* Duchenne muscular dystrophy\n* Hemophilia A and B\n* Fabry disease\n* Hunter syndrome\n\nIn contrast, autosomal dominant disorders (Option A) can affect both males and females equally, while autosomal recessive disorders (Option B) can affect both males and females, but the carrier frequency is higher in the population. X-linked dominant disorders (Option C) are rare and typically affect females more frequently than males.<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14. Therefore, the correct answer is B) TTP<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: The most indicative test for prostate cancer is: Options: A) A thorough digital rectal examination B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) C) Excretory urography D) Prostate-specific antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.\n\nOption A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.\nOption B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

Options: A) t (4;11) B) t (6;9) C) t (8;14) D) t (15;17)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) t (15;17).\n\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by the presence of hypergranular promyelocytes with multiple Auer rods. The t(15;17) translocation is a hallmark of APL, and it involves the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene on chromosome 17. This fusion gene, known as PML-RARA, is responsible for the development of APL.\n\nThe other options are not associated with APL:\n\nA) t(4;11) is associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\n\nB) t(6;9) is associated with AML with a poor prognosis\n\nC) t(8;14) is associated with Burkitt lymphoma\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) t (15;17).<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14. Therefore, the correct answer is B) TTP<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: The most indicative test for prostate cancer is: Options: A) A thorough digital rectal examination B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) C) Excretory urography D) Prostate-specific antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.\n\nOption A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.\nOption B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.

A month ago, she had pneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae cultured from her sputum. On physical examination, she has a body mass index of 35. A random blood glucose value is 132 mg/dL. The next day, fasting blood glucose is 120 mg/dL, followed by a value of 122 mg/ dL on the following day. She is given an oral glucose tolerance test, and her blood glucose is 240 mg/dL 2 hours after receiving the standard 75-g glucose dose. On the basis of these findings, she is prescribed an oral thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug. After 2 months of therapy, her fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/ dL. The beneficial effect of TZD in this patient is most likely related to which of the following processes? Options: A) Activation of PPARg nuclear receptor in adipocytes B) Decreased production of insulin autoantibodies C) Greater density of insulin receptors in adipocytes D) Increased half-life of circulating plasma insulin<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is A) Activation of PPARg nuclear receptor in adipocytes.\n\nThiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a class of medications that activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) nuclear receptor in adipocytes. This activation leads to increased glucose uptake in adipose tissue, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced glucose production in the liver. The patient's fasting blood glucose level decreasing from 122 mg/dL to 90 mg/dL after 2 months of therapy suggests improved insulin sensitivity, which is a hallmark effect of PPAR\u03b3 activation.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nB) Insulin autoantibodies are not directly related to the mechanism of action of TZDs.\n\nC) The density of insulin receptors in adipocytes is not increased by TZDs.\n\nD) The half-life of circulating plasma insulin is not affected by TZDs.\n\nNote: The patient's initial blood glucose values were not diagnostic of diabetes, but the oral glucose tolerance test result suggested impaired glucose tolerance. The patient's body mass index and history of pneumonia with S. pneumoniae infection may have contributed to her insulin resistance.<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14. Therefore, the correct answer is B) TTP<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: The most indicative test for prostate cancer is: Options: A) A thorough digital rectal examination B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) C) Excretory urography D) Prostate-specific antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.\n\nOption A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.\nOption B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.

Options: A) 46, XX B) 46, XY C) 47, XXY D) 47, XYY<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is A) 46, XX.\n\n21-hydroxylase deficiency is a common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is a genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\nIn a female with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the adrenal glands produce excessive amounts of androgens, leading to virilization of the genitalia, resulting in ambiguous genitalia. The karyotype is typically 46, XX, as the genetic material is inherited from the mother.\n\nIn contrast, 46, XY is typically associated with male genitalia, and 47, XXY and 47, XYY are typically associated with Klinefelter syndrome, which is a different genetic disorder.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 46, XX.<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14. Therefore, the correct answer is B) TTP<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: The most indicative test for prostate cancer is: Options: A) A thorough digital rectal examination B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) C) Excretory urography D) Prostate-specific antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.\n\nOption A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.\nOption B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.

C) ABO(H) antigens are present in most body tissues and fluids D) ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen.\n\nThe ABO blood group system is the most important in clinical medicine because:\n\n* ABO(H) antibodies are present in the plasma of individuals who lack the corresponding antigen on their RBCs. This means that if an individual has type A blood, they will have anti-B antibodies in their plasma, and if they have type B blood, they will have anti-A antibodies. This is important in transfusion medicine, as it can cause a severe hemolytic reaction if an individual receives blood that contains the antigen they lack.\n* The ABO(H) antigens are present on the surface of RBCs and are recognized by the immune system, which can lead to an immune response if an individual receives blood that contains the antigen they lack.\n* The ABO(H) blood group system is the most well-studied and widely used blood group system in clinical medicine.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\n* A) The ABO blood group system was not the first blood group system to be discovered. The first blood group system to be discovered was the MN blood group system.\n* B) While there are four main ABO blood groups (A, B, AB, and O), there are many other blood group systems that are also important in clinical medicine.\n* C) ABO(H) antigens are not present in most body tissues and fluids. They are primarily found on the surface of RBCs.<|eot_id|>",
