Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis? Options: A) Osteogenic sarcoma B) Ewing sarcoma C) Osteoclastoma D) Osteiod osteoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n1. We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Role of macrophages in antibody production is? Options: A) Antigen presentation B) B cell production C) Class switching D) B cell activation<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is A) Antigen presentation.\n\nMacrophages play a crucial role in the immune response by presenting antigens to T-cells and B-cells, which helps to activate the immune response. Macrophages engulf and process antigens, breaking them down into smaller peptides that can be presented to T-cells on their surface via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This process is known as antigen presentation.\n\nAntigen presentation is an essential step in the activation of T-cells, which then become activated and proliferate to produce cytokines and other immune mediators that help to eliminate the antigen.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\n* B) B cell production: Macrophages do not produce B-cells.\n* C) Class switching: Macrophages do not play a direct role in class switching, which is the process by which B-cells switch from producing one type of antibody to another.\n* D) B cell activation: While macrophages can activate B-cells by presenting antigens, they do not directly activate B-cells. B-cells are activated by antigens presented by macrophages, but the activation process involves the interaction between the B-cell receptor and the antigen, not the macrophage.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

The mutation leads to the production of hemoglobin S (HbS), which has a different structure and function compared to normal hemoglobin.\n\nThe factors that affect sickling in sickle cell anemia are:\n\n1. HbS concentration: The higher the concentration of HbS, the more likely it is to sickle. This is because HbS molecules tend to aggregate and polymerize when they are present in high concentrations.\n2. Deoxygenation: When HbS is deoxygenated, it becomes more prone to sickling. This is because deoxygenated HbS molecules are more likely to aggregate and polymerize.\n3. Temperature: High temperatures can increase the rate of sickling by increasing the rate of HbS polymerization.\n4. pH: Changes in pH can also affect sickling, although this is less well understood.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* HbA (option B) is not a factor in sickling, as it is not the abnormal hemoglobin responsible for sickle cell anemia.\n* Oxygenation (option D) is a factor that can affect sickling, but it is not the only factor. Deoxygenation can also contribute to sickling.\n* pH (option C) is a factor that can affect sickling, but it is not the primary factor. The primary factor is the concentration of HbS.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Apoptoic bodies are? Options: A) Pyknotic nucleus with organelles B) Opened up chromatin bodies C) Membrane bound cytoplasm without organelles D) Clumped chromatin bodies<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is A) Pyknotic nucleus with organelles.\n\nApoptotic bodies are small, membrane-bound structures that contain cellular components, including organelles, that are released from the cell during the process of apoptosis (programmed cell death). They typically contain a pyknotic nucleus, which is a nucleus that has undergone condensation and fragmentation, as well as organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes.\n\nOption B) Opened up chromatin bodies is not a characteristic of apoptotic bodies. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up the nucleus, and it is typically condensed and compacted during apoptosis, not opened up.\n\nOption C) Membrane-bound cytoplasm without organelles is not a characteristic of apoptotic bodies, as they typically contain organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes.\n\nOption D) Clumped chromatin bodies is not a characteristic of apoptotic bodies. While chromatin is condensed and compacted during apoptosis, it is not typically clumped together in a specific way.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) Pyknotic nucleus with organelles.<|eot_id|>",

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Options: A) Myocyte hypercontracture: B) Leucocyte aggregation C) Free radicals D) Complement activation<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is B) Leucocyte aggregation.\n\nThe \"no-reflow\" phenomenon is a condition where the myocardial tissue fails to reperfuse despite successful recanalization of the occluded coronary artery. This can occur due to various mechanisms, including:\n\n1. Leucocyte aggregation: Leucocytes, particularly neutrophils, can aggregate in the microvasculature, causing obstruction of the capillaries and preventing blood flow to the myocardial tissue.\n2. Myocyte hypercontracture: Myocytes can undergo hypercontracture, leading to increased oxygen demand and further exacerbating the ischemic injury.\n3. Free radicals: Free radicals can damage the microvasculature, leading to increased permeability and edema, which can contribute to the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon.\n4. Complement activation: Complement activation can lead to increased permeability and edema, which can also contribute to the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon.\n\nLeucocyte aggregation is a key mechanism contributing to the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon in acute myocardial infarction, as it can cause direct obstruction of the microvasculature and prevent reperfusion of the myocardial tissue. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Leucocyte aggregation.<|eot_id|>",

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C).

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

They are activated in response to liver injury and undergo a phenotypic transformation into myofibroblasts, which produce collagen and other extracellular matrix components.\n\nStep 4: Kupffer cells are macrophages that reside in the liver and play a role in the immune response, but they are not a major source of collagen in cirrhosis.\n\nStep 5: Hepatocytes are the main functional cells of the liver, responsible for detoxification, metabolism, and synthesis of proteins and other substances. While they can produce some collagen, they are not the primary source of collagen in cirrhosis.\n\nStep 6: Canalicular cells are epithelial cells that line the bile canaliculi and are involved in bile formation and secretion. They do not play a significant role in collagen production in cirrhosis.\n\nConclusion: Based on the above steps, the correct answer is B) Ito cell (Hepatic stellate cell), which is the major source of collagen in cirrhosis.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma.

Options: A) Vitamin B12 B) Sodium C) Albumin D) EFAs<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Generalized body edema is a symptom of a condition where there is an imbalance in the body's fluid balance.\n\nStep 2: The options provided are related to nutrition and electrolytes, which can affect fluid balance.\n\nStep 3: Vitamin B12 is not directly related to fluid balance, so option A can be eliminated.\n\nStep 4: Sodium is an electrolyte that plays a crucial role in fluid balance. However, a deficiency of sodium would typically cause dehydration, not edema.\n\nStep 5: Albumin is a protein that helps regulate fluid balance by maintaining the osmotic pressure in the blood vessels. A deficiency of albumin can lead to edema, as the body tries to compensate by retaining more fluid.\n\nStep 6: EFAs (Essential Fatty Acids) are important for overall health, but they are not directly related to fluid balance or edema.\n\nConclusion: Based on the options, the correct answer is C) Albumin. A deficiency of albumin can lead to generalized body edema. Therefore, the correct answer is C) Albumin<|eot_id|>",

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Vasodilation is the initial response to injury, which increases blood flow to the affected area. This allows for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the damaged tissue and the removal of waste products.\n\nStep 3: Vasodilation is followed by increased permeability (Option A), which allows for the leakage of plasma and proteins from the blood vessels into the interstitial space. This creates an environment that attracts white blood cells to the site of injury.\n\nStep 4: Neutrophil migration (Option C) occurs next, as the white blood cells move through the blood vessels and into the interstitial space in response to chemotactic factors.\n\nStep 5: Vasoconstriction (Option D) is not the first change seen in acute inflammation. In fact, vasoconstriction is a response to injury that occurs later in the inflammatory process, as a way to reduce blood flow to the affected area and prevent excessive bleeding.\n\nConclusion: Based on the sequence of events in acute inflammation, the correct answer is B) Vasodilation.<|eot_id|>",

This expansion leads to an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in the Huntingtin protein, which is toxic to neurons and leads to the characteristic symptoms of the disease.\n\nThe CAG repeat expansion is a type of trinucleotide repeat expansion, which is a specific type of mutation that involves the repeated expansion of a short sequence of DNA (in this case, the CAG sequence) within a gene.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA) Point mutation: A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide base in the DNA sequence, which is not the cause of Huntington's disease.\n\nB) Gene deletion: A gene deletion is the loss of a segment of DNA, which is not the cause of Huntington's disease.\n\nC) Frameshift mutation: A frameshift mutation is a type of mutation that involves the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides, which can alter the reading frame of the genetic code and lead to a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein. While frameshift mutations can occur in the Huntingtin gene, they are not the primary cause of Huntington's disease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Trinucleotide repeat expansion.<|eot_id|>",

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

They are mediated by the activation of mast cells and basophils, which release histamine and other chemical mediators that cause symptoms such as itching, hives, and anaphylaxis.\n\nIgE antibodies play a crucial role in type I hypersensitivity reactions. IgE is produced by B cells in response to an allergen and binds to the surface of mast cells and basophils. When an allergen binds to the IgE antibody, it triggers the release of histamine and other chemical mediators, leading to the symptoms of an allergic reaction.\n\nIgG, IgM, and IgD are not directly involved in type I hypersensitivity reactions. IgG is involved in antibody-mediated immunity, IgM is involved in the primary immune response, and IgD is involved in the activation of B cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) IgE.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Infection can cause haemolytic anemia through various mechanisms, such as:\n\n1. Direct damage to red blood cells: Infections like malaria, babesiosis, and leptospirosis can cause direct damage to red blood cells, leading to their destruction.\n2. Immune-mediated destruction: Infections like autoimmune hemolytic anemia can trigger an immune response that targets and destroys red blood cells.\n3. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia: Infections like sepsis, meningococcemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation can cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, characterized by the destruction of red blood cells due to damage to the blood vessels.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA) Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder that causes red blood cells to become spherical and rigid, leading to their premature destruction. While it can cause anemia, it is not typically caused by infection.\n\nC) Iron deficiency is a nutritional disorder that can cause anemia, but it is not typically associated with haemolytic anemia.\n\nD) Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, leading to abnormal red blood cells that can cause anemia. While it can cause anemia, it is not typically caused by infection.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is not a C-C chemokine? Options: A) IL-18 B) MCP-1 C) Eotaxin D) MIP-1a<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nC-C chemokines are a subfamily of chemokines that are characterized by the presence of a cysteine residue at the second position of the amino acid sequence. They are involved in the recruitment of monocytes, memory T cells, and eosinophils to sites of inflammation.\n\nAmong the options, IL-18 is not a C-C chemokine. IL-18 is a cytokine that belongs to the IL-1 family and is involved in the activation of immune cells.\n\nThe other options are all C-C chemokines:\n\n* MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) is a C-C chemokine that attracts monocytes and memory T cells.\n* Eotaxin is a C-C chemokine that attracts eosinophils.\n* MIP-1a (macrophage inflammatory protein-1a) is a C-C chemokine that attracts monocytes and memory T cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) IL-18.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Options: A) Perihepatic obstruction B) Hemolysis C) Hepatitis D) Liver failure<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Urobilinogen is a breakdown product of hemoglobin that is produced in the liver and excreted in the urine.\n\nStep 2: In normal individuals, most of the urobilinogen is excreted in the urine, with a small amount being reabsorbed and excreted in the bile.\n\nStep 3: In patients with liver disease, the liver's ability to conjugate and excrete urobilinogen is impaired, leading to increased levels of urobilinogen in the blood and decreased levels in the urine.\n\nStep 4: In patients with perihepatic obstruction (Option A), the bile ducts are blocked, preventing the excretion of urobilinogen in the bile. As a result, the liver is unable to conjugate and excrete urobilinogen, leading to increased levels in the blood and urine.\n\nStep 5: In patients with hemolysis (Option B), the breakdown of red blood cells releases large amounts of hemoglobin, which is converted to bilirubin in the liver. The bilirubin is then excreted in the bile and urine. In this case, the liver is able to conjugate and excrete urobilinogen, and the urine would contain normal or increased levels of urobilinogen.\n\nStep 6: In patients with hepatitis (Option C), the liver is inflamed and damaged, leading to impaired conjugation and excretion of urobilinogen. However, the liver is still able to produce some urobilinogen, which would be excreted in the urine.\n\nStep 7: In patients with liver failure (Option D), the liver is severely damaged and unable to conjugate and excrete urobilinogen. As a result, the urine would contain normal or increased levels of urobilinogen.\n\nConclusion: Based on the above steps, the absence of urobilinogen in the urine with icterus (jaundice) suggests that the liver is severely damaged and unable to conjugate and excrete urobilinogen, indicating liver failure (Option D). Therefore, the correct answer is D) Liver failure.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

While it can lead to the formation of tendon xanthomas, it is not as specific as familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\nStep 4: Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (Option C) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the inability to properly metabolize chylomicrons, leading to elevated levels of triglycerides and cholesterol. While it can cause tendon xanthomas, it is not as strongly associated with this condition as familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\nStep 5: Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (Option D) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the inability to properly metabolize triglycerides, leading to elevated levels of triglycerides and cholesterol. While it can cause tendon xanthomas, it is not as strongly associated with this condition as familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\nConclusion: Based on the association between familial hypercholesterolemia and tendon xanthomas, the correct answer is A) Familial hypercholesterolemia.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Options: A) Crohn's disease B) Cat scratch disease C) Hodgkin's disease D) Berrylliosis<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is B) Cat scratch disease.\n\nStellate granuloma is a characteristic pathological feature of cat-scratch disease, which is caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae. The stellate granuloma is a type of granuloma that is typically found in the skin or lymph nodes and is characterized by a star-shaped arrangement of epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells.\n\nCrohn's disease (Option A) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation and granulomas in the gastrointestinal tract, but it is not typically associated with stellate granulomas.\n\nHodgkin's disease (Option C) is a type of lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large, abnormal lymphocytes that are typically found in lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues. While Hodgkin's disease can cause granulomas, they are not typically stellate in shape.\n\nBerrylliosis (Option D) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs, leading to liver damage and other complications. It is not typically associated with stellate granulomas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Cat scratch disease.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Options: A) Nucleus B) Mitochondria C) Endoplasmic reticulum D) Golgi complex<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is B) Mitochondria.\n\nApoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a complex process that involves the activation of various cellular pathways and the involvement of multiple cell organelles. However, the mitochondria play a crucial role in the execution of apoptosis.\n\nDuring apoptosis, the mitochondria undergo a series of changes that ultimately lead to the release of cytochrome c, a protein that triggers a cascade of downstream events that ultimately lead to cell death. The mitochondria also play a role in the regulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which are important regulators of apoptosis.\n\nThe nucleus (Option A) is involved in the regulation of gene expression, but it is not the primary organelle involved in apoptosis.\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (Option C) is involved in protein synthesis and folding, but it is not directly involved in apoptosis.\n\nThe Golgi complex (Option D) is involved in protein modification and secretion, but it is not directly involved in apoptosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Mitochondria.<|eot_id|>",

The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Options: A) AD B) AR C) X linked dominant D) X linked recessive<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) X linked recessive.\n\nX-linked recessive disorders are more common in boys because they inherit the mutated gene from their mother, who is a carrier of the disease. Since boys only have one X chromosome, they are more likely to express the disease if they inherit the mutated gene.\n\nIn contrast, autosomal dominant disorders (Option A) can affect both males and females, as the mutated gene is dominant and can be expressed in either sex.\n\nAutosomal recessive disorders (Option B) can affect both males and females, but the risk of expression is higher in males if they inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent).\n\nX-linked dominant disorders (Option C) are rare and typically affect females, as the mutated gene is dominant and can be expressed in females, who have two X chromosomes. Males, who have only one X chromosome, are usually not affected.\n\nTherefore, boys are more likely to be affected by X-linked recessive disorders, making Option D the correct answer.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

The parents are typically carriers of the mutated gene, but they do not exhibit the disease themselves because they only have one copy of the mutated gene.\n\nIn the case of Wilson's disease, the mutated gene is responsible for the production of a protein called ATP7B, which is involved in the transport of copper out of the liver and into the bile. A deficiency of this protein leads to the accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, causing the symptoms of Wilson's disease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) AR (Autosomal Recessive).<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Podocytes are seen in - Options: A) Bowman's capsule B) Proximal convoluted tubule C) Distal convoluted tubule D) Collecting tubule of the kidney<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Podocytes are specialized cells that play a crucial role in the filtration process in the kidney.\n\nStep 2: Podocytes are found in the glomerulus, which is a structure located in the Bowman's capsule.\n\nStep 3: The Bowman's capsule is a double-layered structure that surrounds the glomerulus and is responsible for filtering the blood.\n\nStep 4: The podocytes are attached to the glomerular basement membrane and have foot processes that interdigitate with those of adjacent podocytes, forming the filtration barrier.\n\nStep 5: The podocytes are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the filtration barrier and regulating the passage of substances into the urine.\n\nConclusion: Based on the above steps, it is clear that podocytes are seen in Option A) Bowman's capsule. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Bowman's capsule.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Broncho-pneumonia due to measles occurs due to Options: A) Sinusitis B) Immuno modulation C) Bronchial obstruction D) Aspiration<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is B) Immuno modulation.\n\nBronchopneumonia due to measles is a common complication of measles, especially in children. It occurs due to the immunosuppressive effects of the measles virus, which impairs the immune system's ability to fight off secondary bacterial infections.\n\nThe measles virus causes a decrease in the production of immunoglobulins, particularly IgG, which are important for fighting off bacterial infections. This immunosuppression makes children with measles more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, which can cause bronchopneumonia.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the development of bronchopneumonia due to measles:\n\nA) Sinusitis is a complication of measles, but it is not the primary cause of bronchopneumonia.\n\nC) Bronchial obstruction is not a direct cause of bronchopneumonia due to measles.\n\nD) Aspiration is not a common complication of measles and is not a primary cause of bronchopneumonia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Immuno modulation.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Which of the following can recognize dead material? Options: A) NET B) Inflammasome C) Necrosis D) Toll-like receptor<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nCorrect answer: B) Inflammasome\n\nExplanation:\n\n* NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps) are a type of extracellular structure formed by neutrophils in response to bacterial infections. They can trap and kill bacteria, but they do not recognize dead material.\n* Necrosis is a type of cell death, but it is not a mechanism for recognizing dead material.\n* Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and are involved in the activation of the innate immune response. While TLRs can recognize dead cells, they are not specific to dead material.\n* Inflammasomes, on the other hand, are multi-protein complexes that recognize and respond to various forms of cellular stress, including dead cells and damaged tissue. They play a crucial role in the activation of the inflammasome pathway, which is involved in the processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Inflammasome.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Most common presentation of gastrinoma/ZES:March 2013 (f, h) Options: A) Abdominal pain B) Duodenal ulcer C) Weight loss D) Nausea<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is C) Weight loss.\n\nGastrinoma, also known as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), is a rare condition characterized by the presence of a gastrin-secreting tumor, usually a gastrinoma, in the pancreas or duodenum. The most common presentation of gastrinoma/ZES is weight loss, which is often accompanied by other symptoms such as:\n\n* Abdominal pain (Option A): This is a common symptom, but not the most common presentation.\n* Duodenal ulcer (Option B): Gastrin stimulates the production of gastric acid, which can lead to the formation of duodenal ulcers.\n* Nausea (Option D): This is a common symptom, but not the most common presentation.\n\nThe high levels of gastrin in ZES patients stimulate the production of gastric acid, leading to hyperchlorhydria, which can cause peptic ulcers, diarrhea, and weight loss. Therefore, weight loss is the most common presentation of gastrinoma/ZES.<|eot_id|>",

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma.

This is because the immune system is attacking and destroying the platelets, leading to a decrease in platelet count, but the bone marrow is still producing more megakaryocytes in an attempt to compensate for the loss.\n\nThe other options are not typical findings in ITP:\n\nA) Absent megakaryocytes: In ITP, the bone marrow would typically show an increase in megakaryocytes, not a complete absence.\n\nB) Foam cells: Foam cells are not typically seen in ITP.\n\nD) Fragmented megakaryocytes: Fragmented megakaryocytes are not a typical finding in ITP.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) Increased megakaryocytes.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Options: A) Coagualtive necrosis B) Liquefactive necrosis C) Caseous necrosis D) Fat necrosis<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) Fat necrosis.\n\nFat necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs when fat cells are damaged due to trauma, infection, or other causes. It is commonly seen in the breast tissue after trauma, such as a blow to the breast or a fall onto the breast. Fat necrosis can also occur in other areas of the body, such as the buttocks or thighs.\n\nCoagulative necrosis (Option A) is a type of necrosis that occurs when cells die due to a lack of blood supply, often as a result of injury or disease. It is not typically associated with trauma to the breast.\n\nLiquefactive necrosis (Option B) is a type of necrosis that occurs when cells die and are replaced by fluid, often as a result of infection or inflammation. It is not typically associated with trauma to the breast.\n\nCaseous necrosis (Option C) is a type of necrosis that occurs when cells die and are replaced by a cheesy or caseous material, often as a result of tuberculosis or other infections. It is not typically associated with trauma to the breast.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Fat necrosis.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Vitamin Bi2 deficiency results in: March 2013 Options: A) Aplastic anemia B) Iron deficiency anemia C) Anemic of chronic diseases D) Macrocytic anemia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for the production of red blood cells, nerve function, and the formation of myelin in the central nervous system.\n\nStep 2: Deficiency in vitamin B12 can lead to a range of symptoms, including anemia, fatigue, weakness, and neurological problems.\n\nStep 3: The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is a lack of intrinsic factor, a protein produced in the stomach that helps absorb vitamin B12 from food.\n\nStep 4: Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a type of anemia characterized by macrocytes (large red blood cells) and hypersegmented neutrophils (white blood cells).\n\nStep 5: The anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency is typically macrocytic (macrocytic anemia), which is characterized by an increase in the size of red blood cells.\n\nConclusion: Based on the above steps, the correct answer is D) Macrocytic anemia. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Macrocytic anemia<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Cross-linking of collagen theory (B): This theory suggests that aging is caused by the cross-linking of collagen fibers, which leads to the loss of elasticity and flexibility in skin and other tissues.\n3. Telomere shortening theory (C): This theory proposes that aging is caused by the shortening of telomeres, which are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes. As telomeres shorten, cells are unable to divide and eventually die.\n4. Glycation theory (not listed): This theory suggests that aging is caused by the accumulation of advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) in the body, which can damage proteins and other molecules.\n\nLysosomal degeneration theory is not a widely accepted theory of aging mechanism.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

In adults, AFP is normally produced by the liver and is present in small amounts in the blood. However, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AFP levels are often elevated due to the production of AFP by the tumor cells.\n\nAFP is a sensitive and specific marker for HCC, and its levels can be used to monitor the progression of the disease and response to treatment. Elevated AFP levels can also be used to screen for HCC in high-risk populations, such as those with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\n* B) Prostate carcinoma: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a marker for prostate cancer, not AFP.\n* C) Renal cell carcinoma: Renal cell carcinoma is typically associated with elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and chromogranin A, not AFP.\n* D) Colon carcinoma: CEA is a marker for colon cancer, not AFP.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 25-year-old man experiences acute onset of fever, cough, dyspnea, headache, and malaise a day after moving into a new apartment.

A chest radiograph also is unremarkable. Which of the following pathogenic mechanisms is most likely to produce these findings? Options: A) Antigen-antibody complex-mediated injury B) Antibody-mediated injury to basement membrane C) Formation of mycolic acid as a result of tubercular infection D) Generation of prostaglandins by basophil recruitment<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: The patient's symptoms are consistent with an acute onset of respiratory symptoms, including fever, cough, dyspnea, headache, and malaise.\n\nStep 2: The patient's symptoms resolve when he visits a friend in another city, and then recur when he returns to his original location. This suggests that the symptoms are related to his environment.\n\nStep 3: The patient's physical examination is normal, and the chest radiograph is unremarkable. This suggests that the symptoms are not caused by a primary pulmonary disease.\n\nStep 4: The most likely pathogenic mechanism is hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which is an allergic reaction to inhaled antigens. This can occur in response to exposure to mold, bacteria, or other environmental allergens.\n\nStep 5: The symptoms are consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which can cause fever, cough, dyspnea, headache, and malaise. The symptoms resolve when the patient is removed from the allergenic environment and recur when he returns to the same environment.\n\nConclusion: Based on the patient's symptoms and the fact that they resolve when he is removed from the environment and recur when he returns, the most likely pathogenic mechanism is hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Antigen-antibody complex-mediated injury.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Which of the following conditions is associated with decreased E-cadherin? Options: A) Invasive lobular carcinoma B) Fibroid C) Ductal carcinoma D) Intestinal carcinoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nE-cadherin is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and is often referred to as a \"cancer suppressor\". In many types of cancer, including breast cancer, E-cadherin is downregulated or lost, leading to the loss of cell-cell adhesion and the acquisition of a more invasive phenotype.\n\nInvasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is a type of breast cancer that is characterized by the loss of E-cadherin expression. ILC is a distinct subtype of breast cancer that accounts for approximately 10-15% of all breast cancers. The loss of E-cadherin is a hallmark of ILC and is thought to contribute to the invasive and metastatic behavior of these tumors.\n\nFibroids (option B) are benign tumors that arise from the smooth muscle cells of the uterus and are not typically associated with changes in E-cadherin expression.\n\nDuctal carcinoma (option C) is a type of breast cancer that is characterized by the loss of E-cadherin expression, but it is not as specific as ILC.\n\nIntestinal carcinoma (option D) is a type of cancer that can arise in the colon or rectum and is not typically associated with changes in E-cadherin expression.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) Invasive lobular carcinoma.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Telomerase is an enzyme that maintains telomere length by adding telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes. In normal cells, telomerase is inactive, and telomeres shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular senescence or apoptosis.\n\nHowever, in cancer cells, telomerase is reactivated, allowing them to bypass the normal limits on the number of cell divisions and continue to proliferate indefinitely. This is one of the key mechanisms by which cancer cells can become immortal.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nB) Telomerase inactivation is not a mechanism of tumorogenesis in aging.\n\nC) Increased apoptosis (programmed cell death) is actually a mechanism by which cells can eliminate damaged or mutated cells, including cancer cells, to prevent tumor formation.\n\nD) Suppression of proto-oncogenes is not a mechanism of tumorogenesis in aging. Proto-oncogenes are genes that can become oncogenes if they are mutated or overexpressed, leading to cancer.

The features of PNH include:\n\n* Hemolysis: The most common symptom of PNH is hemolysis, which is the destruction of red blood cells. This can lead to anemia, jaundice, and dark urine.\n* Thrombosis: PNH patients are at increased risk of developing thromboses, particularly in the liver, kidneys, and brain.\n* Thrombocytopenia: PNH patients often have a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe lactate dehydrogenase (LAP) score is a measure of the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood. LDH is an enzyme that is released from damaged red blood cells. In PNH, the LAP score is often decreased, not increased, due to the destruction of red blood cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) Increased LAP score.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A baby girl born with ambiguous genitalia is found to have 21-hydroxylase deficiency of the salt-wasting type.

Options: A) 46, XX B) 46, XY C) 47, XXY D) 47, XYY<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: The patient has ambiguous genitalia, which suggests that the baby has a disorder of sex development (DSD).\n\nStep 2: The diagnosis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency of the salt-wasting type suggests that the baby has Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH).\n\nStep 3: CAH is typically caused by a mutation in the CYP21A2 gene, which codes for the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. This enzyme is necessary for the production of cortisol and aldosterone.\n\nStep 4: The karyotype of a person with CAH is typically 46, XX or 46, XY, as CAH is not related to sex chromosome abnormalities.\n\nStep 5: The presence of ambiguous genitalia in a baby with CAH is due to the high levels of androgens produced by the adrenal glands, which can cause virilization of the female genitalia.\n\nConclusion: Based on the diagnosis of CAH and the presence of ambiguous genitalia, we would expect to find a karyotype of either 46, XX or 46, XY. Therefore, the correct answer is either A) 46, XX or B) 46, XY.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

In sickle cell disease, a single nucleotide change in the HBB gene leads to the substitution of glutamic acid for valine at position 6 of the hemoglobin beta chain. This results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin S, which causes the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped and leads to the characteristic symptoms of the disease.\n\nThalassemia (Option A) is a type of hemoglobinopathy caused by a frameshift mutation or a deletion of nucleotides, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin.\n\nSideroblastic anemia (Option C) is a type of anemia caused by a defect in iron metabolism, but it is not a result of a missense mutation.\n\nHemochromatosis (Option D) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the HFE gene, which leads to an overload of iron in the body. While it is a genetic disorder, it is not a result of a missense mutation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Sickle cell disease.<|eot_id|>",

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C).

Options: A) Type I B) Type II C) Type III D) Type IV<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGranulomatous inflammation is a characteristic feature of Type IV hypersensitivity.\n\nType IV hypersensitivity is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, which occurs when T-cells recognize and respond to antigens. This type of reaction is often associated with granuloma formation, which is a collection of immune cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and epithelioid cells, that surround and engulf the antigen.\n\nIn granulomatous inflammation, the immune response is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of activated macrophages and other immune cells that attempt to eliminate the antigen. This type of inflammation is often seen in response to infections, such as tuberculosis, leprosy, and fungal infections, as well as in response to certain medications and other foreign substances.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\n* Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction, which occurs within minutes to hours after exposure to an allergen, and is characterized by the release of histamine and other chemical mediators from mast cells.\n* Type II hypersensitivity is an antibody-mediated reaction, which occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the surface of cells or in the bloodstream, leading to cell damage or destruction.\n* Type III hypersensitivity is an immune complex-mediated reaction, which occurs when antibodies bind to antigens, forming immune complexes that deposit in tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Type IV.<|eot_id|>",

Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions: This is the most common cause of lung abscesses, accounting for approximately 60-70% of cases. Aspiration of food, liquids, or other substances into the lungs can lead to the formation of an abscess.\n2. Hematogenous spread: This occurs when bacteria from the bloodstream spread to the lungs and cause an abscess. This is less common than aspiration, but can occur in cases of sepsis or endocarditis.\n3. Direct extension: This occurs when an abscess forms in the lung tissue itself, often as a result of a penetrating injury or a tumor.\n4. Congenital defects: Congenital defects, such as cystic fibrosis or bronchogenic cysts, can increase the risk of developing a lung abscess.\n\nTuberculosis (Option A) is a common cause of lung disease, but it is not typically associated with lung abscesses. Congenital lung defects (Option B) can increase the risk of developing lung abscesses, but are not the most common cause. Hematogenous spread (Option C) is a less common cause of lung abscesses, and is often associated with sepsis or endocarditis.<|eot_id|>",

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.

This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

C) ABO(H) antigens are present in most body tissues and fluids D) ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The ABO blood group system is the most important in clinical medicine because the ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when a person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen.\n* This means that if a person has type A blood, they will have anti-B antibodies in their plasma, and if they have type B blood, they will have anti-A antibodies. If they have type AB blood, they will not have any ABO antibodies, and if they have type O blood, they will have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.\n* This is important in transfusion medicine because it means that if a person with type A blood receives type B blood, their immune system will recognize the B antigen as foreign and produce antibodies against it, leading to a severe reaction.\n* The ABO blood group system is also important because it is the most common cause of blood transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the newborn.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\n* A) The ABO blood group system was not the first blood group system to be discovered. The first blood group system to be discovered was the MN blood group system.\n* B) There are four main blood groups in the ABO system: A, B, AB, and O, but this is not the reason why the ABO blood group system is the most important in clinical medicine.\n* C) ABO(H) antigens are not present in most body tissues and fluids. They are only present on the surface of RBCs.<|eot_id|>",

What is the likely diagnosis? Options: A) Candidiasis B) Herpes C) CMV D) Eosinophilic Esophagitis<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Interpret the fundoscopic finding\nThe \"Pizza Pie Appearance\" on fundoscopy suggests a diagnosis of CMV retinitis, which is a common opportunistic ocular infection in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the biopsy specimen\nThe biopsy specimen shows large cells with an \"Owl's Eye Appearance.\" This appearance is typical of CMV infection, characterized by the presence of intranuclear inclusions that are 8-10 micrometers in size and surrounded by a clear peripheral halo.\n\nStep 3: Consider the histopathological features\nThe presence of large cells with Owl's Eye Appearance in the biopsy specimen is consistent with CMV infection. These cells are typically 2-4 times larger than surrounding cells and contain an intranuclear inclusion body.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate other possibilities\nCandidiasis and herpes are both opportunistic infections that can occur in HIV-infected patients, but they do not typically present with the characteristic histopathological features described in the biopsy specimen. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that is not typically associated with the findings described.\n\nStep 5: Make the diagnosis\nBased on the combination of the fundoscopic finding and the histopathological features of the biopsy specimen, the likely diagnosis is CMV infection, specifically CMV retinitis and CMV esophagitis.\n\nAnswer: C) CMV Therefore, the correct answer is C) CMV<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Which is the BEST site for taking biopsy in a case of viral oesophagitis? Options: A) Edge of ulcer B) Base of ulcer C) Adjacent indurated area around ulcer D) Surrounding normal mucosa<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nOptions: A) Edge of ulcer, B) Base of ulcer, C) Adjacent indurated area around ulcer, D) Surrounding normal mucosa\n\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: Identify the type of esophagitis: The patient has viral esophagitis, specifically HSV (herpes simplex virus) esophagitis.\n\nStep 2: Determine the location of the infection: HSV esophagitis commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus.\n\nStep 3: Identify the characteristic features of HSV infection: Microscopically, the characteristic features of HSV infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions.\n\nStep 4: Determine the best site for biopsy: Given the characteristic features of HSV infection, the best site for biopsy is the edge of the ulcer, where the squamous epithelium is present.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the patient's bleeding symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a history of frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. However, the physical examination is normal, which rules out obvious signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are normal, which suggests that anemia is not the primary cause of the bleeding. The platelet count is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia. The WBC count is also normal, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammatory process.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the platelet aggregation studies. The patient's platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin, which suggests a defect in platelet function. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease.\n\nStep 4: Consider the patient's platelet function defect. The deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa suggests a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the coagulation studies. The prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are normal, which suggests that there is no underlying coagulopathy.\n\nConclusion: Based on the stepwise evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Wound healing begins with platelet adhesion to exposed matrix integrins, which bind to collagen and laminin. This leads to platelet aggregation and granule release.\n\nStep 2: The platelet granules trigger an inflammatory response, attracting white blood cells to the site of injury. These cells bind to integrins on endothelial cells and extravasate through the blood vessel walls.\n\nStep 3: Cytokines released by white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury. Macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells play crucial roles in wound healing and scar formation.\n\nStep 4: Plasmin, an enzyme, aids in the healing process by removing excess fibrin, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound and restore the epithelium under the scab.\n\nStep 5: Collagen production increases, leading to the formation of a scar. At this point, the wound has gained approximately 20% of its ultimate strength.\n\nStep 6: Further collagen production and remodeling occur, allowing the wound to gain more strength over time. However, the strength of the wound never exceeds about 70% of the strength of normal skin.\n\nConclusion: Based on this stepwise process, it can be concluded that nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after 3 weeks of wound healing (Option C). Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis? Options: A) Osteogenic sarcoma B) Ewing sarcoma C) Osteoclastoma D) Osteiod osteoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n1. We are looking for a bone tumor that arises from the metaphysis, which is the region of the bone where the growth plate is located.\n2. We can eliminate options C) Osteoclastoma and D) Osteiod osteoma, as they typically occur in the epiphysis (the end of the bone) or diaphysis (the shaft of the bone), respectively.\n3. Option B) Ewing sarcoma can occur in the metaphysis, but it is more commonly found in the diaphysis. So, we can't rule it out yet.\n4. Option A) Osteogenic sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can occur in the metaphysis. It is a common location for this type of tumor.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the tumor, we can conclude that the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: In hemophiliac patients, which of the following should not be given? Options: A) Factor VIII concentrate B) Cryoprecipitate C) EACA D) Platelet factor<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII (FVIII). Hemophilia B is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of clotting factor IX (FIX).\n\nStep 2: Factor VIII concentrate is the treatment of choice for hemophilia A. It replaces the deficient FVIII and helps to prevent bleeding episodes.\n\nStep 3: Cryoprecipitate is a blood product that contains FVIII, FIX, and fibrinogen. It can be used to treat hemophilia A and B, as well as other bleeding disorders.\n\nStep 4: EACA (Epsilon-aminocaproic acid) is an antifibrinolytic medication that inhibits the breakdown of blood clots. It is sometimes used to treat bleeding episodes in hemophilia patients, but it is not a replacement therapy for FVIII or FIX.\n\nStep 5: Platelet factor is not a standard treatment for hemophilia A or B. Platelets play a role in primary hemostasis, but they are not directly involved in the coagulation cascade.\n\nConclusion: Based on the options, the correct answer is D) Platelet factor. Platelet factor is not a treatment for hemophilia A or B, and it is not a replacement therapy for FVIII or FIX. Therefore, it should not be given to hemophilia patients.<|eot_id|>",

Examples include allergic reactions to pollen, peanuts, and insect bites.\n* Type II: Antibody-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, where IgG or IgM antibodies bind to antigens on the surface of cells or tissues, leading to damage or destruction. Examples include autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Goodpasture's syndrome.\n* Type III: Immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, where immune complexes form in the blood and tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Examples include rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.\n* Type IV: Cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, also known as delayed hypersensitivity, where T cells recognize and respond to antigens, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Examples include contact dermatitis and tuberculosis.\n\nIn a cell-mediated immune response, T cells recognize and respond to antigens, leading to the activation of other immune cells, such as macrophages and cytotoxic T cells, which can cause tissue damage and inflammation. This type of response is often delayed, hence the term \"delayed hypersensitivity\".<|eot_id|>",
