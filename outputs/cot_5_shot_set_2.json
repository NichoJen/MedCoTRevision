Options: A) Candidiasis B) Herpes C) CMV D) Eosinophilic Esophagitis<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nPizza Pie Appearance of Retina on fundoscopy in an HIV infected patient suggests probable diagnosis of CMV Retinitis. The Histolpathological slide from the Upper GI Endoscopy biospy specimen shows presence of large (cytomegalic) cells with Owl&;s eye appearance. This appearance is typical of CMV infection. Pizza Pie Appearance of Retina on fundoscopy in an HIV infected patient suggests CMV Cytomegalovirus retinitis is the single most common oppounistic ocular infection seen in immunocompromised patients including those affected with HIV CMV retinitis in HIV patients is characterized by haemorrhage and necrosis in a perivascular distribution, with loss of fundal details, giving it the classical &;Pizza Pie&; Appearance This appearance is also termed as \"Cheese and ketchup\" appearance. Owl&;s eye Appearance from Intranuclear Inclusions in Biopsy Specimen suggests CMV infection Cells infected with CMV are two to four times larger than surrounding cells (cytomegalic) in vivo and often contain an 8- to 10- micromts intranuclear basophilic (or amphophilic ) inclusion body that is eccentrically placed and is surrounded by a clear peripheral halo, producing an \"owl eye\" appearance (sometimes called Bull&;s eye appearance) Smaller inclusions may also be demostrated in the cytoplasm occasionally (Typically basophillic and smaller) Cytomegalic cells are found in a wide variety of organs, including the salivary glands, lung, liver, kidney, intestine, pancreas, adrenal gland and central nervous system. Virus Inclusion Description Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Cowdry type A Intranuclear Basophilic (or Amphophilic) inclusions surrounded by a halo and by marginated chromatin Intracytoplasmic Inclusions consists of clusters of small granular basophilic bodies of various sizes Ref: Harrison&;s 19th edition Pgno: 1191 Therefore, the correct answer is C) CMV<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Which is the BEST site for taking biopsy in a case of viral oesophagitis? Options: A) Edge of ulcer B) Base of ulcer C) Adjacent indurated area around ulcer D) Surrounding normal mucosa<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe best place to take biopsy is from within the the squamous mucosa at the edges of the ulcer and in sloughed cells within the exudate. HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis? Options: A) Osteogenic sarcoma B) Ewing sarcoma C) Osteoclastoma D) Osteiod osteoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. is 'a' i.e., Osteogenic sarcomaMetaphvseal lesions Diaphyseal lesions o Osteogenic sarcoma o Ewing sarcomao Unicameral (simple) bone cyst o Lymphomaso Aneurysmal bone cyst o Fibrous dysplasiao Fibrous coical defect o AdamantinomaHistiocytosisOsteoid osteoma Therefore, the correct answer is A) Osteogenic sarcoma<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Role of macrophages in antibody production is? Options: A) Antigen presentation B) B cell production C) Class switching D) B cell activation<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is A) Antigen presentation.\n\nMacrophages play a crucial role in the immune response by presenting antigens to T-cells, which helps to activate the T-cells and trigger an immune response. This process is known as antigen presentation. Macrophages engulf and process antigens, breaking them down into smaller peptides, and then present these peptides to T-cells through their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This helps to activate T-cells, which then become activated and proliferate, leading to the production of antibodies and other immune responses.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\n* B) B cell production: Macrophages do not produce B cells.\n* C) Class switching: Macrophages do not play a direct role in class switching, which is the process by which B cells switch from producing one type of antibody to another.\n* D) B cell activation: While macrophages can activate B cells, this is not their primary role. Their primary role is in antigen presentation, which helps to activate T-cells, which in turn activate B cells.<|eot_id|>",

The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

The disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. This means that if one parent has the condition, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene and developing the condition.\n\nTuberous sclerosis is characterized by the growth of benign tumors in various parts of the body, including the brain, heart, kidneys, and skin. The tumors can cause a range of symptoms, including seizures, developmental delays, and skin abnormalities.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

It is a marker for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, a type of thyroid cancer that arises from these C cells. Elevated levels of calcitonin in the blood are often used as a diagnostic marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA) Prostate cancer: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a marker for prostate cancer, not calcitonin.\n\nC) Pheochromocytoma: Pheochromocytoma is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that produces catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Calcitonin is not a marker for pheochromocytoma.\n\nD) Pancreatic cancer: Calcitonin is not a marker for pancreatic cancer.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

These activated Ito cells produce excessive amounts of collagen, leading to the deposition of scar tissue and the formation of fibrosis.\n\nKupffer cells are macrophages that reside in the liver and play a role in the immune response, but they are not a major source of collagen.\n\nHepatocytes are the main functional cells of the liver and are responsible for synthesizing and secreting various proteins, including albumin and clotting factors. While they can produce some collagen, they are not the primary source of collagen in cirrhosis.\n\nCanalicular cells are the cells that line the bile canaliculi and are involved in bile secretion and transport. They do not play a significant role in collagen production.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Ito cell (Hepatic stellate cell).<|eot_id|>",

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation.

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Options: A) 10% B) 15% C) 25% D) 50%<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is C) 25%.\n\nIn autosomal recessive inheritance, the probability of an affected child is 25% when both parents are carriers of the recessive allele. This is because each parent has a 50% chance of passing on the recessive allele to their offspring, and the offspring must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (one from each parent) to express the condition.\n\nSo, the probability of an affected child is:\n\n* 50% chance of inheriting the recessive allele from one parent\n* 50% chance of inheriting the recessive allele from the other parent\n* 25% chance of inheriting two recessive alleles (one from each parent) and being affected\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) 25%.<|eot_id|>",

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

When albumin levels are low, fluid leaks out of the blood vessels and into the tissues, leading to edema.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency is not typically associated with generalized body edema. Sodium is an electrolyte that helps regulate fluid balance in the body, but its deficiency is not typically associated with generalized edema. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are important for various bodily functions, but their deficiency is not typically associated with generalized edema.\n\nHypoalbuminemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including liver disease, kidney disease, malnutrition, and certain medications. Treatment of hypoalbuminemia typically involves addressing the underlying cause and managing symptoms such as edema with diuretics and fluid restriction.<|eot_id|>",

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

The term \"kebab\" is thought to have originated from the appearance of the treated bone, which resembles a kebab or a skewer.\n\nPaget's disease is a chronic bone disorder characterized by abnormal bone remodeling, leading to enlargement and deformity of the affected bones. The kebab treatment is a minimally invasive procedure that is used to treat the condition, particularly in cases where other treatments have failed.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that is treated with medications, physical therapy, and joint replacement surgery.\n* Myositis ossificans is a condition in which muscle tissue is replaced with bone, and it is typically treated with physical therapy and pain management.\n* Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder that affects bone development and is treated with medications, physical therapy, and orthotics.<|eot_id|>",

Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

The most common mutation is the C282Y mutation, which is found in approximately 80-90% of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. This mutation leads to an accumulation of iron in the body, particularly in the liver, pancreas, and other organs, which can cause damage and lead to symptoms such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and arthritis.\n\nH63D is another common mutation, but it is less common than C282Y and is often associated with a milder form of the disease. TFR2 and SLC11A3 are not typically associated with hereditary hemochromatosis.\n\nIt's worth noting that genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis typically involves testing for the C282Y and H63D mutations, as these are the most common and clinically relevant mutations.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Cytochrome C then binds to Apaf1 (Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1), which is a protein that is normally sequestered in the cytosol. The binding of cytochrome C to Apaf1 triggers the activation of caspase-9, which is a key enzyme in the execution of apoptosis.\n\nBc1-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) is a protein that inhibits apoptosis by preventing the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria. FADD (Fas-associated death domain) is a protein that is involved in the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which is triggered by death receptors such as Fas. TNF (tumor necrosis factor) is a cytokine that can induce apoptosis, but it is not directly involved in the action of cytochrome C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) Apaf1.<|eot_id|>",

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

The exact mechanism of ARF is not fully understood, but it is thought to be caused by an autoimmune response triggered by cross-reactivity between the streptococcal M protein and host tissues.\n\nThe M protein on the surface of the streptococcus is highly immunogenic and can stimulate an immune response. During the course of the infection, the immune system produces antibodies against the M protein, which can cross-react with similar epitopes on host tissues, such as the heart, joints, and skin. This cross-reactivity leads to an inflammatory response and tissue damage, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of ARF, including carditis, polyarthritis, and chorea.\n\nThe other options are not accurate mechanisms of ARF:\n\n* B) Innocent bystander effect: This is a phenomenon where an immune response is triggered by an antigen that is not the primary target of the immune response. While this can occur in some cases, it is not the primary mechanism of ARF.\n* C) Toxin secretion by streptococci: While streptococci do produce toxins, such as streptolysin O, these toxins are not thought to play a primary role in the pathogenesis of ARF.\n* D) Release of pyrogenic cytokines: While cytokines can play a role in the inflammatory response, they are not the primary mechanism of ARF.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

The tumor is characterized by the presence of signet ring cells in the ovary, which are typically seen in gastric adenocarcinoma. The tumor is named after the Norwegian pathologist Fredrik Krukenberg, who first described it in 1896.\n\nGastric adenocarcinoma is the most common primary site for Krukenberg tumor, accounting for approximately 70-80% of cases. The tumor typically presents as a bilateral ovarian mass, often with ascites and pleural effusion. The prognosis is generally poor, and the tumor is often resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.<|eot_id|>",

The Histolpathological slide from the Upper GI Endoscopy biospy specimen shows presence of large (cytomegalic) cells with Owl&;s eye appearance. This appearance is typical of CMV infection. Pizza Pie Appearance of Retina on fundoscopy in an HIV infected patient suggests CMV Cytomegalovirus retinitis is the single most common oppounistic ocular infection seen in immunocompromised patients including those affected with HIV CMV retinitis in HIV patients is characterized by haemorrhage and necrosis in a perivascular distribution, with loss of fundal details, giving it the classical &;Pizza Pie&; Appearance This appearance is also termed as \"Cheese and ketchup\" appearance. Owl&;s eye Appearance from Intranuclear Inclusions in Biopsy Specimen suggests CMV infection Cells infected with CMV are two to four times larger than surrounding cells (cytomegalic) in vivo and often contain an 8- to 10- micromts intranuclear basophilic (or amphophilic ) inclusion body that is eccentrically placed and is surrounded by a clear peripheral halo, producing an \"owl eye\" appearance (sometimes called Bull&;s eye appearance) Smaller inclusions may also be demostrated in the cytoplasm occasionally (Typically basophillic and smaller) Cytomegalic cells are found in a wide variety of organs, including the salivary glands, lung, liver, kidney, intestine, pancreas, adrenal gland and central nervous system.

Options: A) Edge of ulcer B) Base of ulcer C) Adjacent indurated area around ulcer D) Surrounding normal mucosa<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe best place to take biopsy is from within the the squamous mucosa at the edges of the ulcer and in sloughed cells within the exudate. HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

They are a characteristic feature of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disorder that causes high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. The lesions typically appear as yellowish nodules or plaques on the tendons, particularly on the hands, feet, and Achilles tendons.\n\nFamilial hyperlipidemia (B) is a broader term that refers to a group of disorders characterized by elevated levels of lipids in the blood, but it does not specifically cause tendon xanthomas.\n\nFamilial dysbetalipoproteinemia (C) is a rare genetic disorder that causes the accumulation of chylomicrons and VLDL in the blood, leading to hyperlipidemia, but it is not typically associated with tendon xanthomas.\n\nFamilial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (D) is a rare genetic disorder that causes the deficiency of an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides, leading to hypertriglyceridemia, but it is not typically associated with tendon xanthomas.<|eot_id|>",

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

The lesion appears a lytic on X-rays film with a circumscribed punched out appearance. The curetting from fracture site is most likely to show which of the following - Options: A) Diminished and thinned trabecular bone fragments secondary to osteopenia B) Sheets of atypical plasma cells C) Metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma D) Malignant cells forming osteoid bone<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is B) Sheets of atypical plasma cells.\n\nThe description of the lesion as a lytic, circumscribed, and punched-out appearance on X-ray film is highly suggestive of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a type of plasma cell neoplasm that typically affects older adults and is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow. The tumor cells produce an excessive amount of monoclonal immunoglobulin, which can lead to the formation of lytic bone lesions.\n\nThe curetting from the fracture site is likely to show sheets of atypical plasma cells, which are the characteristic histopathological feature of multiple myeloma. The other options are not consistent with the description of the lesion:\n\nA) Diminished and thinned trabecular bone fragments secondary to osteopenia is more consistent with osteoporosis, which is a common condition in older adults, but it is not typically associated with a circumscribed, punched-out appearance on X-ray film.\n\nC) Metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma can cause lytic bone lesions, but they are typically more irregular and destructive than those seen in multiple myeloma.\n\nD) Malignant cells forming osteoid bone is not a characteristic feature of multiple myeloma, which is a plasma cell neoplasm that does not typically produce bone tissue.<|eot_id|>",

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

It is produced by the endothelium and plays a role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. PGI2 causes vasodilation by stimulating the production of cyclic AMP in smooth muscle cells, which leads to relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. Additionally, PGI2 inhibits platelet aggregation by activating the enzyme adenylate cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic AMP in platelets, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.<|eot_id|>",

The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal.

However, the mitochondria play a crucial role in the execution of apoptosis.\n\nDuring apoptosis, the mitochondria undergo a series of changes that lead to the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors into the cytosol. This triggers a cascade of downstream events that ultimately lead to the activation of caspases, which are the executioners of apoptosis.\n\nThe mitochondria are often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" of the cell, as they generate most of the cell's energy in the form of ATP. However, during apoptosis, the mitochondria can also act as \"executioners\" by releasing pro-apoptotic factors that trigger the cell's demise.\n\nThe other options are not directly involved in the process of apoptosis:\n\n* The nucleus is involved in the regulation of gene expression, but it is not the primary site of apoptosis.\n* The endoplasmic reticulum is involved in protein synthesis and folding, but it is not directly involved in apoptosis.\n* The Golgi complex is involved in protein modification and secretion, but it is not directly involved in apoptosis.<|eot_id|>",

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Options: A) Fibrinoid B) Coagulative C) Caseous D) Liquefactive<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is B) Coagulative.\n\nCoagulative necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs when the blood supply to a tissue or organ is suddenly cut off, leading to the death of cells. This type of necrosis is characterized by the preservation of the cellular architecture, with the cells appearing to be \"coagulated\" or \"frozen\" in place.\n\nIn this scenario, the patient presented with chest pain and died within 12 hours, and the autopsy showed necrosis in the myocardium 5 days later. This is consistent with coagulative necrosis, which typically occurs when there is sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, leading to myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n\nFibrinoid necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to inflammation and is characterized by the deposition of fibrin in the affected tissue.\n\nCaseous necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to infection, typically with mycobacteria, and is characterized by the formation of a cheesy or caseous material.\n\nLiquefactive necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs when there is a sudden and complete loss of blood supply to a tissue or organ, leading to the breakdown of cellular structures and the formation of a liquid or gelatinous material.<|eot_id|>",

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

D) Primary sclerosing cholangitis<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is C) Primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and eventually cirrhosis. It is characterized by the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in the blood, which are directed against the mitochondrial enzymes of the bile duct epithelial cells.\n\nThe symptoms of PBC include:\n\n* Jaundice\n* Pruritus\n* Fatigue\n* Abdominal pain\n* Weight loss\n* Dark urine and pale stools\n\nThe laboratory findings in PBC typically include:\n\n* Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels\n* Elevated bilirubin levels\n* Positive AMA test\n* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs)\n\nThe presence of periocular and intra digital xanthomas (yellowish deposits of cholesterol) is also a characteristic feature of PBC.\n\nLeptospirosis (A) is a bacterial infection caused by Leptospira spp., which is typically characterized by fever, headache, and muscle aches, but not jaundice or xanthomas.\n\nMacronodular cirrhosis (B) is a rare liver disease characterized by the presence of large nodules in the liver, which can be caused by various etiologies, including liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or liver abscesses.\n\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis (D) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the bile ducts, leading to fibrosis and stricture formation. While it can cause jaundice and pruritus, it is not typically associated with xanthomas.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is primary biliary cirrhosis (C).<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

It is a vascular tumor that is composed of abnormal blood vessels and can be solitary or multiple. Hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies or at the time of surgery. They can be classified into two types: capillary hemangioma and cavernous hemangioma. Capillary hemangioma is the most common type and is characterized by a proliferation of small, thin-walled blood vessels. Cavernous hemangioma is a larger, more complex lesion that is composed of larger, more dilated blood vessels.\n\nPapilloma is a type of benign tumor that arises from the lining of the bile ducts and is usually located in the intrahepatic bile ducts.\n\nHepatic adenoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the liver cells and is usually solitary.\n\nAmoeboma is not a recognized term in medical literature.<|eot_id|>",

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Options: A) Neutrophil B) Monocytes C) Eosinophils D) Free radicals<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) Free radicals.\n\nMyocardial reperfusion injury occurs when the blood flow to the heart muscle is restored after a period of ischemia (reduced blood flow). This can cause damage to the heart muscle, leading to cell death and inflammation.\n\nFree radicals, which are highly reactive molecules that contain unpaired electrons, play a key role in the pathophysiology of myocardial reperfusion injury. When the blood flow is restored, the heart muscle is exposed to oxygen and other nutrients, which can lead to the formation of free radicals. These free radicals can damage the heart muscle cells, leading to cell death and inflammation.\n\nNeutrophils (Option A) are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the inflammatory response, but they are not the primary cause of myocardial reperfusion injury.\n\nMonocytes (Option B) are a type of white blood cell that matures into macrophages, which are involved in the removal of cellular debris and foreign substances from the body. While monocytes may be involved in the inflammatory response after myocardial reperfusion injury, they are not the primary cause of the injury.\n\nEosinophils (Option C) are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the inflammatory response, but they are not typically involved in myocardial reperfusion injury.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Free radicals.<|eot_id|>",

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

As a result, the infected red blood cells may not be present in the peripheral blood, making it difficult to diagnose the infection by examining a peripheral blood smear. This is known as \"sequestration\" of the parasites.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA) Apoptosis of red cells because of hemozoin pigments: Hemozoin is a byproduct of the breakdown of hemoglobin by the parasite, but it does not cause apoptosis of red cells.\n\nB) Lysis of red cells with malarial parasite: While the parasite can cause lysis of red cells, this is not the reason why the peripheral blood smear may not demonstrate trophozoites and schizonts.\n\nC) Infested cells are trapped in the spleen: The spleen is an important organ for filtering the blood and removing infected red cells, but it is not the primary site of sequestration for P. falciparum parasites.<|eot_id|>",

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

These genes are involved in the complement system, which is a part of the innate immune response.\n\nThe HLA class III region genes are not directly involved in antigen presentation and elimination (option B), transplant rejection (option A), or immune surveillance (option C). However, they do play a role in the regulation of the immune response and have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Governing susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.<|eot_id|>",

Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Peripheral blood smear shows basophilic stippling of the RBCs. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Coeliac disease B) Hookworm disease C) Sickle cell disease D) Lead poisoning<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) Lead poisoning.\n\nBasophilic stippling of red blood cells is a characteristic finding in lead poisoning. Lead can accumulate in the bone marrow and cause the formation of basophilic stippling, which is a result of the deposition of lead in the RBCs. This can lead to anemia, abdominal pain, and other systemic symptoms.\n\nCoeliac disease (Option A) is an autoimmune disorder that causes malabsorption of nutrients, including iron, leading to anemia. However, it does not typically cause basophilic stippling.\n\nHookworm disease (Option B) is a parasitic infection that can cause anemia, but it does not typically cause basophilic stippling.\n\nSickle cell disease (Option C) is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal hemoglobin production, leading to sickling of RBCs. While it can cause anemia, it does not typically cause basophilic stippling.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is lead poisoning (Option D).<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

She had worked as a technician in a nuclear energy plant for 15 years and was involved in an accident during which she was exposed to considerable radiation. Physical examination reveals an enlarged liver and spleen. What disease should you suspect as a likely cause of her condition? Options: A) Chronic myelogenous leukemia B) Hairy cell leukemia C) Metastatic carcinoma of the breast D) Metastatic carcinoma of the stomach<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is A) Chronic myelogenous leukemia.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and easy bruising, along with the physical examination findings of an enlarged liver and spleen, are consistent with a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). CML is a type of leukemia that is caused by a genetic mutation in the BCR-ABL1 gene, which is often associated with radiation exposure. The patient's history of working in a nuclear energy plant and being involved in an accident during which she was exposed to considerable radiation increases the likelihood of CML.\n\nHairy cell leukemia (B) is a type of chronic lymphocytic leukemia that is characterized by the presence of hairy cells in the blood and bone marrow. While it can cause fatigue and weakness, it is not typically associated with radiation exposure.\n\nMetastatic carcinoma of the breast (D) or stomach (D) can cause symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, and easy bruising, but it would not typically cause an enlarged liver and spleen.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not specific to CML, and a definitive diagnosis would require further testing, such as a complete blood count, bone marrow biopsy, and genetic testing.<|eot_id|>",

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal.

The prognosis of crescentic glomerulonephritis is directly related to the number of crescents present. The more crescents present, the worse the prognosis.\n\nThe number of crescents is a strong predictor of the likelihood of progression to end-stage renal disease. Patients with fewer than 10% crescents have a good prognosis, while those with 10-50% crescents have a moderate prognosis, and those with more than 50% crescents have a poor prognosis.\n\nThe size, shape, and cellularity of the crescents are not as important predictors of prognosis as the number of crescents. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

They are composed of a protein called ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and the pro-caspase-1 enzyme. When an inflammasome is activated, it cleaves pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which then cleaves the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 into its active form, leading to the release of IL-1\u03b2 and the activation of the immune response.<|eot_id|>",

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

The most common presentation of gastrinoma/ZES is weight loss, which is often accompanied by other symptoms such as:\n\n* Abdominal pain (Option A)\n* Nausea and vomiting (Option D)\n* Diarrhea or steatorrhea\n* Recurrent peptic ulcers, including duodenal ulcers (Option B)\n\nThe symptoms of ZES are often insidious and may not be specific, making diagnosis challenging. The diagnosis is typically made by measuring serum gastrin levels and performing an upper GI endoscopy with gastric acid secretion testing. Treatment typically involves surgical resection of the tumor and acid-reducing medications.<|eot_id|>",

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

It is a radioimmunoassay that uses Raji cells, a type of human B-cell lymphoma cell line, as the target cells. The assay measures the binding of immune complexes to the Raji cells, which is proportional to the amount of immune complexes present in the sample.\n\nImmune complexes are aggregates of antibodies and antigens that form in response to an immune response. They can be found in the blood and other bodily fluids and can be a sign of various autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and vasculitis.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA) Complement levels are measured using a different assay, such as the CH50 assay.\n\nC) T-cells are measured using a different assay, such as the CD4/CD8 ratio.\n\nD) IFN levels are measured using a different assay, such as ELISA or Western blot.<|eot_id|>",

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

On physical examination, she is afebrile, and her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Laboratory findings show the serum creatinine level is 5.8 mg/dL. C3 nephritic factor is present in serum, resulting in hypocomplementemia, and the ANA test result is negative. Urinalysis shows 2+ blood and 1+ protein. A renal biopsy is done; microscopic examination shows hypercellular glomeruli and prominent ribbonlike deposits along the lamina densa of the glomerular basement membrane. Which of the following forms of glomerulonephritis is most likely to be present in this patient? Options: A) Chronic glomerulonephritis B) Dense deposit disease C) Membranous nephropathy D) Postinfectious glomerulonephritis<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is B) Dense deposit disease.\n\nDense deposit disease, also known as type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, is a type of glomerulonephritis characterized by the presence of dense deposits in the glomerular basement membrane. These deposits are composed of immune complexes, primarily composed of IgG and C3, which are deposited along the lamina densa of the glomerular basement membrane. The deposits can cause inflammation and damage to the glomerular basement membrane, leading to proteinuria, hematuria, and nephritic syndrome.\n\nThe presence of C3 nephritic factor in the patient's serum, which is an autoantibody that binds to C3 convertase and prevents the breakdown of C3, is consistent with the diagnosis of dense deposit disease.\n\nThe other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings:\n\n* Chronic glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerulonephritis that occurs as a result of chronic inflammation and scarring of the glomeruli, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.\n* Membranous nephropathy is a type of glomerulonephritis characterized by the deposition of immune complexes in the glomerular basement membrane, but it is not typically associated with the presence of C3 nephritic factor.\n* Postinfectious glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerulonephritis that occurs as a result of an immune response to a previous infection, typically streptococcal infection, and is not typically associated with the presence of C3 nephritic factor.<|eot_id|>",

Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

A) Lipofuscin granules in cardiac cells Lipofuscin is a type of cellular waste material that accumulates in the cells of various tissues, including the heart, as a result of the breakdown of damaged or dysfunctional organelles. It is a normal byproduct of cellular metabolism and is often seen in the cells of older individuals. In the heart, lipofuscin granules are typically found in the cardiac myocytes and are a common finding in the hearts of older individuals. They are not specific to heart failure, but can be seen in a variety of cardiac conditions, including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and valvular disease.

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

A chest X-ray reveals an infiltrate in the right middle lobe. Sputum cultures are positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Phagocytic cells in this patient's affected lung tissue generate bactericidal hypochlorous acid using which of the following enzymes? Options: A) Catalase B) Cyclooxygenase C) Myeloperoxidase D) Superoxide dismutase<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is C) Myeloperoxidase.\n\nMyeloperoxidase is an enzyme found in neutrophil granulocytes that plays a key role in the killing of bacteria and other microorganisms. It catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and chloride ions (Cl-). HOCl is a potent antimicrobial agent that helps to kill bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the causative agent of the patient's pneumonia.\n\nCatalase (A) is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water and oxygen, and is not involved in the production of hypochlorous acid.\n\nCyclooxygenase (B) is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and other eicosanoids, and is not related to the production of hypochlorous acid.\n\nSuperoxide dismutase (D) is an enzyme that converts superoxide anions (O2-) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is then converted to hypochlorous acid by myeloperoxidase. However, it is not directly involved in the production of hypochlorous acid.<|eot_id|>",

Coronary angiography shows a fixed 75% narrowing of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. He has several risk factors for atherosclerosis: smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Which of the following is the earliest event resulting from the effects of these factors? Options: A) Alteration in vasomotor tone regulation B) Conversion of smooth muscle cells to foam cells C) Dysfunction from endothelial injury D) Inhibition of LDL oxidation<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) Inhibition of LDL oxidation.\n\nThe earliest event in the development of atherosclerosis is the modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which is the primary cholesterol-carrying lipoprotein in the blood. LDL cholesterol is normally taken up by the liver and other tissues, but in the presence of certain risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, LDL cholesterol can become oxidized, leading to the formation of oxidized LDL (oxLDL).\n\nOxLDL is highly atherogenic, meaning it is more likely to accumulate in the arterial wall and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. The oxidation of LDL cholesterol is the first step in the development of atherosclerosis, and it sets off a cascade of events that ultimately leads to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques.\n\nThe other options are not the earliest events in the development of atherosclerosis:\n\nA) Alteration in vasomotor tone regulation: This is a later event that occurs as atherosclerosis progresses and the blood vessels become narrowed and stiffened.\n\nB) Conversion of smooth muscle cells to foam cells: This is a later event that occurs as atherosclerosis progresses and the smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall become activated and begin to take up LDL cholesterol, leading to the formation of foam cells.\n\nC) Dysfunction from endothelial injury: This is a later event that occurs as atherosclerosis progresses and the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels become damaged, leading to the loss of their normal function and the development of atherosclerotic plaques.<|eot_id|>",

Options: A) Edge of ulcer B) Base of ulcer C) Adjacent indurated area around ulcer D) Surrounding normal mucosa<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe best place to take biopsy is from within the the squamous mucosa at the edges of the ulcer and in sloughed cells within the exudate. HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Options: A) Coagualtive necrosis B) Liquefactive necrosis C) Caseous necrosis D) Fat necrosis<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) Fat necrosis.\n\nFat necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs when fat cells are damaged, usually due to trauma, surgery, or radiation. It is characterized by the breakdown of fat cells, leading to the release of fatty acids and glycerol into the surrounding tissue. This can cause inflammation and the formation of a granuloma.\n\nCoagulative necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs when cells die due to a lack of blood supply, often as a result of injury or disease. It is characterized by the preservation of cell structure, but with a loss of cellular function.\n\nLiquefactive necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs when cells die due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients, often as a result of infection or inflammation. It is characterized by the breakdown of cells and the release of cellular contents into the surrounding tissue.\n\nCaseous necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs when cells die due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients, often as a result of infection or inflammation. It is characterized by the formation of a cheesy or caseous material that is composed of dead cells and cellular debris.\n\nIn the context of trauma to the breast, fat necrosis is the most likely type of necrosis to occur, as it is a common complication of breast trauma.<|eot_id|>",

Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

The stools are black due to the presence of digested blood, which has been in the gut for a longer period of time, allowing for the breakdown of hemoglobin into bilirubin.\n\nHematemesis (A) refers to vomiting blood, which is not related to the patient's symptoms.\n\nHematobilia (B) is a rare condition where there is bleeding from the bile ducts, which is not related to peptic ulcer disease.\n\nHematochezia (C) refers to bleeding from the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract, typically from the colon or rectum, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n\nIn this case, the patient's symptoms of black stools (melena) and hypochromic, microcytic anemia are consistent with bleeding from a duodenal ulcer, which is a common complication of peptic ulcer disease.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

One of the key steps in apoptosis is the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, which allows the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors into the cytosol.\n\nThe mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is a critical step in the activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, which is triggered by various cellular stresses, such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, or growth factor withdrawal.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA) Nuclear membrane: The nuclear membrane does not play a direct role in apoptosis.\n\nB) Cytoplasmic membrane: The cytoplasmic membrane is not directly involved in apoptosis.\n\nC) Lysosome: Lysosomes are involved in the degradation of cellular components, but they are not directly involved in apoptosis.<|eot_id|>",

Over time, the macrophages can become activated and release pro-inflammatory mediators, leading to the development of chronic inflammation and fibrosis, which can cause respiratory symptoms and lung damage.\n\nEndothelial cells (Option A) are involved in the formation of blood vessels and the regulation of blood flow, but they are not primarily responsible for sequestering coal dust.\n\nFibroblasts (Option B) are involved in the production of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, which can contribute to the development of fibrosis, but they are not directly involved in the sequestration of coal dust.\n\nLymphocytes (Option C) are involved in the immune response and can become activated in response to the presence of coal dust, but they are not primarily responsible for sequestering the dust.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Macrophages.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Options: A) Nodular sclerosis B) Lymphocyte predominance C) Lymphocyte depletion D) Mixed cellularity<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is A) Nodular sclerosis.\n\nLacunar cells are a type of Reed-Sternberg cell that is characteristic of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma (NSHL). They are typically seen in the lymph nodes and are characterized by the presence of a clear space or \"lacuna\" within the cytoplasm, which is thought to be a result of the cell's inability to maintain its cytoplasmic membrane.\n\nNodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are typically large, binucleate or multinucleate cells with a characteristic \"owl's eye\" appearance. The disease typically affects young adults and is more common in women than men.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* Lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by a predominance of lymphocytes, but not lacunar cells.\n* Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by a depletion of lymphocytes, but not lacunar cells.\n* Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by a mixture of lymphocytes and other cell types, but not lacunar cells.<|eot_id|>",

The fact that the symptoms occur after moving into a new apartment and then recur when the patient returns to the same location suggests that the patient may be reacting to an environmental allergen or irritant.\n\nAntigen-antibody complex-mediated injury is a type of hypersensitivity reaction that occurs when an individual is exposed to an antigen, such as a mold or dust mite, and their immune system produces antibodies to that antigen. The antigen-antibody complexes that form can cause an inflammatory response, leading to symptoms such as fever, cough, and respiratory distress.\n\nThe other options are not as likely to produce these symptoms:\n\n* Antibody-mediated injury to basement membrane (B) is a type of autoimmune disorder that typically causes symptoms such as hematuria and proteinuria, rather than respiratory symptoms.\n* Formation of mycolic acid as a result of tubercular infection (C) is not a likely cause of the symptoms described, as mycolic acid is a component of the mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall, and the symptoms described are not typical of tuberculosis.\n* Generation of prostaglandins by basophil recruitment (D) is a mechanism that is more commonly associated with allergic reactions, but it is not the most likely explanation for the symptoms described, as the patient's symptoms are not limited to the respiratory tract.<|eot_id|>",

The next day, fasting blood glucose is 120 mg/dL, followed by a value of 122 mg/ dL on the following day. She is given an oral glucose tolerance test, and her blood glucose is 240 mg/dL 2 hours after receiving the standard 75-g glucose dose. On the basis of these findings, she is prescribed an oral thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug. After 2 months of therapy, her fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/ dL. The beneficial effect of TZD in this patient is most likely related to which of the following processes? Options: A) Activation of PPARg nuclear receptor in adipocytes B) Decreased production of insulin autoantibodies C) Greater density of insulin receptors in adipocytes D) Increased half-life of circulating plasma insulin<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is A) Activation of PPARg nuclear receptor in adipocytes.\n\nThiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a class of medications that activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) nuclear receptor in adipocytes. This activation leads to increased expression of genes involved in glucose uptake and storage in adipose tissue, resulting in improved insulin sensitivity and reduced glucose production in the liver.\n\nIn this patient, the oral glucose tolerance test showed impaired glucose tolerance, indicating insulin resistance. The prescription of a TZD likely improved insulin sensitivity, allowing the patient's body to better utilize glucose and reducing her blood glucose levels. The activation of PPARg in adipocytes is the primary mechanism by which TZDs improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nB) Insulin autoantibodies are not relevant to the mechanism of action of TZDs.\n\nC) The density of insulin receptors in adipocytes is not directly affected by TZDs.\n\nD) The half-life of circulating plasma insulin is not increased by TZDs.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Telomerase is an enzyme that maintains telomere length by adding telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes. In normal cells, telomerase is inactive, and telomeres shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular senescence or apoptosis. However, in cancer cells, telomerase is reactivated, allowing them to bypass the normal limits on the number of cell divisions and become immortal.\n\nAs people age, the telomeres naturally shorten, and this shortening is thought to contribute to the development of age-related diseases, such as cancer and atherosclerosis. Therefore, telomerase reactivation is a key mechanism by which cancer cells can evade the normal constraints on cell division and become immortal.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\n* B) Telomerase inactivation: Telomerase is actually reactivated in cancer cells, not inactivated.\n* C) Increased apoptosis: Apoptosis is a normal process that occurs in aging, but it is not the primary mechanism of tumorogenesis.\n* D) Suppression of proto-oncogenes: Proto-oncogenes are genes that can become oncogenes if they are mutated or overexpressed. While the suppression of proto-oncogenes may play a role in cancer prevention, it is not the primary mechanism of tumorogenesis in aging.<|eot_id|>",

Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Which of the following karyotypes would you expect to find in this baby? Options: A) 46, XX B) 46, XY C) 47, XXY D) 47, XYY<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is A) 46, XX.\n\n21-hydroxylase deficiency is a common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a group of disorders that affect the adrenal glands. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is an autosomal recessive disorder.\n\nIn this condition, the enzyme 21-hydroxylase is deficient or defective, leading to a block in the production of cortisol and aldosterone. This can cause a range of symptoms, including ambiguous genitalia in females, as well as other signs of adrenal insufficiency.\n\nThe karyotype of a person with 21-hydroxylase deficiency is typically 46, XX, as it is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the adrenal glands, which are not sex-specific. The sex chromosomes (X or Y) do not play a role in the development of CAH.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n* 46, XY is a typical karyotype for a male, but it is not specific to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\n* 47, XXY is a karyotype that is typically associated with Klinefelter syndrome, a condition that is characterized by hypogonadism and infertility in males.\n* 47, XYY is a karyotype that is typically associated with Klinefelter syndrome, a condition that is characterized by hypogonadism and infertility in males.<|eot_id|>",

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

The Histolpathological slide from the Upper GI Endoscopy biospy specimen shows presence of large (cytomegalic) cells with Owl&;s eye appearance. This appearance is typical of CMV infection. Pizza Pie Appearance of Retina on fundoscopy in an HIV infected patient suggests CMV Cytomegalovirus retinitis is the single most common oppounistic ocular infection seen in immunocompromised patients including those affected with HIV CMV retinitis in HIV patients is characterized by haemorrhage and necrosis in a perivascular distribution, with loss of fundal details, giving it the classical &;Pizza Pie&; Appearance This appearance is also termed as \"Cheese and ketchup\" appearance. Owl&;s eye Appearance from Intranuclear Inclusions in Biopsy Specimen suggests CMV infection Cells infected with CMV are two to four times larger than surrounding cells (cytomegalic) in vivo and often contain an 8- to 10- micromts intranuclear basophilic (or amphophilic ) inclusion body that is eccentrically placed and is surrounded by a clear peripheral halo, producing an \"owl eye\" appearance (sometimes called Bull&;s eye appearance) Smaller inclusions may also be demostrated in the cytoplasm occasionally (Typically basophillic and smaller) Cytomegalic cells are found in a wide variety of organs, including the salivary glands, lung, liver, kidney, intestine, pancreas, adrenal gland and central nervous system.

Options: A) Edge of ulcer B) Base of ulcer C) Adjacent indurated area around ulcer D) Surrounding normal mucosa<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe best place to take biopsy is from within the the squamous mucosa at the edges of the ulcer and in sloughed cells within the exudate. HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

It is often caused by certain medications, including valproate (Depakote), which is an anticonvulsant medication.\n\nValproate is a known cause of microvesicular fatty liver, particularly in children and adolescents. The exact mechanism of this effect is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and the accumulation of fatty acids in the liver.\n\nThe other options are not typically associated with microvesicular fatty liver:\n\n* DM (Diabetes Mellitus) can cause a range of liver injuries, including steatosis (fatty liver), but it is not typically characterized by microvesicular fatty liver.\n* Starvation can cause a range of liver injuries, including fatty liver, but it is not typically characterized by microvesicular fatty liver.\n* IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause a range of liver injuries, including steatosis and fibrosis, but it is not typically associated with microvesicular fatty liver.<|eot_id|>",

Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A). Ref: Morson and Dawson's Gastrointestinal Pathology edited by Neil A. Shepherd, page 27. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

The main difference between the two is the presence of cytokeratin in mesothelioma, which is a marker of epithelial differentiation. Cytokeratin is a protein that is typically expressed in epithelial cells, and its presence in a tumor is a characteristic feature of mesothelioma.\n\nCD14 is a marker of monocytes and macrophages, and is not typically expressed in pleural fibroma or mesothelioma.\n\nCD24 is a marker of B cells and is not typically expressed in pleural fibroma or mesothelioma.\n\nErbB is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in cell signaling pathways, and is not a specific marker for pleural fibroma or mesothelioma.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) Cytokeratin.<|eot_id|>",

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

She reports amenorrhea for the past year and states that she recently required a larger shoe size. Laboratory studies show impaired glucose tolerance. What other procedure would be useful for establishing your diagnosis? Options: A) CBC with differential count B) CT scan of the abdomen C) MRI of the sella turcica D) Test for serum 21-hydroxylase<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe symptoms described, such as headache, visual disturbances, deepening of the voice, generalized weakness, and amenorrhea, are consistent with Cushing's syndrome. The patient's impaired glucose tolerance is also a common feature of Cushing's syndrome.\n\nThe most useful procedure for establishing the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome would be:\n\nC) MRI of the sella turcica\n\nThis is because Cushing's syndrome is typically caused by an adrenal tumor or hyperplasia, which can be detected by imaging studies such as MRI or CT scan. An MRI of the sella turcica would help to identify any pituitary adenoma or other lesions that may be causing the excess production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excessive amounts of cortisol.\n\nThe other options are not as relevant to the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome:\n\nA) CBC with differential count: This would not provide any information about the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nB) CT scan of the abdomen: While a CT scan of the abdomen may be useful in identifying an adrenal tumor, it is not the most sensitive or specific test for Cushing's syndrome.\n\nD) Test for serum 21-hydroxylase: This test is used to diagnose congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is a different condition that is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. While some patients with Cushing's syndrome may have elevated levels of 21-hydroxylase, this test is not specific for Cushing's syndrome and would not be the most useful diagnostic test in this case.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) Edge of ulcer<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 3 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Bone tumour arising from metaphysis?

Options: A) Type I B) Type II C) Type III D) Type IV<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) Type IV.\n\nGranulomatous inflammation is a type of chronic inflammatory response that occurs in response to the presence of an antigen, often a foreign substance such as a bacterium, virus, or fungus. This type of inflammation is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of activated macrophages and other immune cells that engulf and digest the antigen.\n\nType IV hypersensitivity is a type of cell-mediated immune response that involves the activation of T-lymphocytes and the release of cytokines, which attract and activate other immune cells. This type of hypersensitivity is responsible for the development of granulomatous inflammation.\n\nType I hypersensitivity is an immediate-type reaction that occurs within minutes to hours after exposure to an allergen, and is characterized by the release of histamine and other chemical mediators from mast cells.\n\nType II hypersensitivity is an antibody-mediated reaction that occurs when an antibody binds to an antigen on the surface of a cell, leading to the activation of complement and the destruction of the cell.\n\nType III hypersensitivity is an immune complex-mediated reaction that occurs when an antibody binds to an antigen, forming an immune complex that activates complement and leads to the activation of neutrophils and the release of chemical mediators.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Type IV.<|eot_id|>",

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

Postpartum autoimmune disorders are a group of conditions that occur in some women after childbirth, often triggered by hormonal changes. One of the most common postpartum autoimmune disorders is postpartum autoimmune thrombocytopenia, which is characterized by a decrease in platelet count and can cause bleeding and bruising.\n\nFunctional platelet defect is a type of platelet disorder that can cause bleeding and bruising. It is characterized by a defect in platelet function, rather than a decrease in platelet count.\n\nMegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (Option A) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a decrease in platelet count and a defect in platelet production.\n\nAmegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (Option B) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a decrease in platelet count and a defect in platelet production.\n\nAcquired Factor VIII inhibitors (Option D) are antibodies that develop in some individuals with hemophilia A, which can cause bleeding and joint pain.

Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis? Options: A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura D) Vitamin C deficiency<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008 Options: A) 1 week of wound healing B) 2 weeks of wound healing C) 3 weeks of wound healing D) 4 weeks of wound healing<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAns. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

On physical examination, her skin has a bronze color. Liver function tests show reduced serum albumin. Which of the following findings would most likely appear in a liver biopsy specimen? Options: A) Amyloid in portal triads B) Bilirubin in canaliculi C) Glycogen in hepatocyte D) Hemosiderin in hepatocytes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) Hemosiderin in hepatocytes.\n\nThe patient's history of multiple transfusions of RBCs over many years has led to iron overload, which is causing the bronze skin color (hyperpigmentation). The liver biopsy specimen would show hemosiderin deposition in the hepatocytes, which is a common complication of chronic iron overload.\n\nAmyloid deposition in portal triads is not typically associated with iron overload. Bilirubin deposition in canaliculi is more commonly seen in conditions such as Dubin-Johnson syndrome or Rotor syndrome. Glycogen deposition in hepatocytes is not typically associated with iron overload.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Hemosiderin in hepatocytes.<|eot_id|>",

Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.

C) ABO(H) antigens are present in most body tissues and fluids D) ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen.\n\nThe ABO blood group system is the most important in clinical medicine because the presence or absence of A and B antigens on red blood cells (RBCs) determines the individual's blood type, and the presence or absence of A and B antibodies in the plasma. When an individual's RBCs lack the corresponding antigen, their plasma will contain antibodies against that antigen. This means that if an individual with type A blood receives a transfusion of type B blood, their plasma will recognize the B antigen on the transfused RBCs as foreign and trigger an immune response, leading to hemolysis (breakdown) of the transfused RBCs.\n\nThis is why the ABO blood group system is crucial in blood transfusion medicine, as it is essential to ensure that the blood being transfused is compatible with the recipient's blood type to prevent adverse reactions.<|eot_id|>",
