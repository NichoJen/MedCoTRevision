In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14. Therefore, the correct answer is B) TTP<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: The most indicative test for prostate cancer is: Options: A) A thorough digital rectal examination B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) C) Excretory urography D) Prostate-specific antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.\n\nOption A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.\nOption B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.

Options: A) Myocyte hypercontracture: B) Leucocyte aggregation C) Free radicals D) Complement activation<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is B) Leucocyte aggregation.\n\nThe \"no-reflow\" phenomenon is a condition where the myocardial tissue does not receive adequate blood flow despite successful reperfusion after an acute myocardial infarction. Leucocyte aggregation is a major contributor to this phenomenon. Leucocytes, particularly neutrophils, can adhere to the endothelium and form aggregates, which can occlude the microvasculature and prevent blood flow to the myocardium.\n\nMyocyte hypercontracture (Option A) is a phenomenon where the myocytes contract excessively, leading to increased oxygen demand and potentially worsening ischaemia.\n\nFree radicals (Option C) can contribute to reperfusion injury, but they are not the primary cause of the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon.\n\nComplement activation (Option D) can also contribute to reperfusion injury, but it is not a direct cause of the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Leucocyte aggregation.<|eot_id|>",

Options: A) Clathrin B) Histamine C) Interferon D) Tumor-necrosis-factor (TNT)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nCachexia is a common complication of advanced cancer, characterized by weight loss, muscle wasting, and loss of body mass. The major contributor to cachexia in advanced cancer is Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).\n\nTNF-alpha is a cytokine produced by immune cells in response to tumor presence, and it plays a key role in the development of cachexia. It stimulates the breakdown of muscle protein and fat, leading to weight loss and muscle wasting.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to cachexia:\n\n* Clathrin is a protein involved in endocytosis and is not related to cancer cachexia.\n* Histamine is a neurotransmitter involved in allergic reactions and is not a major contributor to cachexia.\n* Interferon is an antiviral protein that can be produced by the immune system in response to viral infections, but it is not a major contributor to cancer cachexia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Tumor-necrosis-factor (TNT).<|eot_id|>",

The mechanism of ARF is thought to be an autoimmune response, where the immune system mistakenly targets the host's own tissues, particularly the heart, joints, and skin, due to cross-reactivity with antigens shared between the streptococcus and the host.\n\nThe streptococcal antigens trigger an immune response, which leads to the production of antibodies that cross-react with the host's own tissues, causing inflammation and damage. This cross-reactivity is thought to be the primary mechanism underlying the development of ARF.\n\nThe other options are not accurate mechanisms of ARF:\n\n* Option B: Innocent bystander effect is a phenomenon where an immune response is triggered by an antigen, but the response is not specific to that antigen.\n* Option C: Streptococci do not secrete toxins that cause ARF.\n* Option D: While pyrogenic cytokines may be involved in the inflammatory response, they are not the primary mechanism of ARF.<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

The cause of increased susceptibility to infections is - Options: A) Defective neutrophil degranulation B) Defective production of prostaglandins C) An inability to produce hydroxyhalide radicals D) Decreased oxygen consumption after phagocytosis<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMyeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils. ROS are important for the killing of bacteria and other microorganisms. In the absence of MPO, neutrophils are unable to produce ROS, which makes them less effective at killing bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) An inability to produce hydroxyhalide radicals. Hydroxyhalide radicals are a type of ROS that are produced by the action of MPO on hydrogen peroxide. The deficiency in MPO leads to a decrease in the production of these radicals, making the patient more susceptible to bacterial infections.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA) Defective neutrophil degranulation is a condition where neutrophils are unable to release their granules, which contain enzymes and other antimicrobial factors. This would not be the cause of recurrent bacterial infections in this patient.\n\nB) Defective production of prostaglandins is not related to the function of myeloperoxidase or the production of reactive oxygen species.\n\nD) Decreased oxygen consumption after phagocytosis is not a known consequence of MPO deficiency.<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

Options: A) AD B) AR C) X linked dominant D) X linked recessive<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) X-linked recessive.\n\nX-linked recessive disorders are more common in boys because they inherit the mutated gene from their mother, who is a carrier of the disease. Since the gene is located on the X chromosome, boys have only one X chromosome, so if they inherit the mutated gene, they will express the disease. Girls, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so even if they inherit the mutated gene, the normal gene on the other X chromosome can mask the effects of the mutated gene, making them carriers but not affected.\n\nExamples of X-linked recessive disorders that are more common in boys include:\n\n* Duchenne muscular dystrophy\n* Hemophilia A and B\n* Fabry disease\n* Lesch-Nyhan syndrome\n\nIn contrast, autosomal dominant disorders (Option A) can affect both males and females, while autosomal recessive disorders (Option B) can affect both males and females, but the carrier frequency is higher in the population. X-linked dominant disorders (Option C) are rare and typically affect females, as the dominant gene on the X chromosome is enough to cause the disease.<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14. Therefore, the correct answer is B) TTP<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: The most indicative test for prostate cancer is: Options: A) A thorough digital rectal examination B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) C) Excretory urography D) Prostate-specific antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.\n\nOption A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.\nOption B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.

The reason for this is: Options: A) Apoptosis of red cells because of hemozoin pigments B) Lysis of red cells with malarial parasite C) Infested cells are trapped in the spleen D) Infested red blood cells stick to the capillaries<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) Infested red blood cells stick to the capillaries.\n\nIn Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the parasites sequester in the capillaries and post-capillary venules, where they continue to grow and multiply. As a result, the infected red blood cells are not seen in the peripheral blood smear, as they are stuck in the capillaries and not circulating freely. This is known as \"cytoadherence\" or \"sequestration\".\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA) Apoptosis of red cells because of hemozoin pigments: Hemozoin is a byproduct of the parasite's metabolism, but it does not cause apoptosis of red cells.\n\nB) Lysis of red cells with malarial parasite: While the parasite can cause lysis of red cells, this is not the reason why the infected cells are not seen in the peripheral blood smear.\n\nC) Infested cells are trapped in the spleen: The spleen is an organ that filters the blood and removes old or damaged red blood cells, but it is not responsible for trapping infected red blood cells in this way.<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14. Therefore, the correct answer is B) TTP<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: The most indicative test for prostate cancer is: Options: A) A thorough digital rectal examination B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) C) Excretory urography D) Prostate-specific antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.\n\nOption A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.\nOption B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.

On the basis of these findings, she is prescribed an oral thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug. After 2 months of therapy, her fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/ dL. The beneficial effect of TZD in this patient is most likely related to which of the following processes?

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

Options: A) 46, XX B) 46, XY C) 47, XXY D) 47, XYY<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is A) 46, XX.\n\n21-hydroxylase deficiency is a common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is a genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\nIn a female with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the karyotype is typically 46, XX, meaning she has two X chromosomes. The deficiency in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase leads to a block in the production of cortisol and aldosterone, resulting in a range of symptoms including ambiguous genitalia, hypertension, and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* 46, XY is typically found in males, who have one X and one Y chromosome.\n* 47, XXY is a karyotype typically found in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, a condition characterized by hypogonadism and infertility.\n* 47, XYY is a karyotype typically found in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, but it is not associated with CAH or ambiguous genitalia.<|eot_id|>",

Options: A) Arnold-Chiari malformation B) Broca's aphasia C) Horner's syndrome D) Tabes dorsalis<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest a lesion affecting the spinothalamic tract, which is responsible for transmitting pain and temperature sensations from the body to the brain. The preservation of touch sensation suggests that the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, which is responsible for transmitting touch and vibration sensations, is intact.\n\nThe most common cause of a lesion affecting the spinothalamic tract in a young adult is a thoracic spinal cord injury, which can occur due to trauma, infection, or tumor.\n\nArnold-Chiari malformation is a congenital condition that can cause compression of the spinal cord and brainstem, but it is not typically associated with a sudden onset of symptoms in a 27-year-old man.\n\nBroca's aphasia is a type of language disorder that is caused by damage to the left inferior frontal gyrus, and is not related to sensory loss.\n\nHorner's syndrome is a condition that affects the sympathetic nervous system and can cause miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis, but it is not typically associated with sensory loss.\n\nTabes dorsalis is a condition that occurs in advanced syphilis and can cause degeneration of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, leading to loss of vibration and position sense. However, it is not typically associated with loss of pain and temperature sensation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) Arnold-Chiari malformation.<|eot_id|>",

This missense mutation causes the production of abnormal hemoglobin S, which polymerizes and causes the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped.\n\nThalassemia is an example of a nonsense mutation, where a premature stop codon is introduced, leading to a truncated protein.\n\nSideroblastic anemia is a type of anemia characterized by the presence of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow, but it is not caused by a specific mutation.\n\nHemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which leads to an inability to regulate iron absorption. While it is a genetic disorder, it is not a classic example of a missense mutation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Sickle cell disease.<|eot_id|>",

Options: A) Basophilic leukocytosis B) Eosinophilic leukocytosis C) Lymphocytosis D) Monocytosis<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is B) Eosinophilic leukocytosis.\n\nEosinophilia is a common feature of severe atopic asthma, particularly in patients with eosinophilic bronchitis or eosinophilic pneumonia. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the inflammatory response, and their increased numbers in the blood can indicate an allergic reaction or an allergic disease such as atopic asthma.\n\nBasophilic leukocytosis (Option A) is not typically associated with atopic asthma.\n\nLymphocytosis (Option C) can occur in atopic asthma, but it is not as specific or sensitive as eosinophilia.\n\nMonocytosis (Option D) is not typically associated with atopic asthma.\n\nIt's worth noting that the diagnosis of atopic asthma is typically made based on a combination of clinical symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory tests, including spirometry, methacholine challenge, and blood tests for IgE antibodies.<|eot_id|>",

Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.

PATP is an autoimmune disorder, and the patient's family history of autoimmune disease increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.\n\nMegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (Option A) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a decrease in platelet production.\n\nAmegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (Option B) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a decrease in megakaryocytes (platelet-producing cells) and platelet count.\n\nAcquired Factor VIII inhibitors (Option D) are antibodies that inhibit the function of Factor VIII, a clotting factor, and are typically seen in patients with hemophilia A. While this condition can cause bleeding, it is not typically associated with a skin rash and joint pains.<|eot_id|>",

In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14. Therefore, the correct answer is B) TTP<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nQuestion: The most indicative test for prostate cancer is: Options: A) A thorough digital rectal examination B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) C) Excretory urography D) Prostate-specific antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAn elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.\n\nOption A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.\nOption B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.

C) ABO(H) antigens are present in most body tissues and fluids D) ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is D) ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen.\n\nThe ABO blood group system is the most important in clinical medicine because:\n\n* ABO(H) antibodies are present in the plasma of individuals who lack the corresponding antigen on their RBCs. This means that if a person has type A blood, they will have antibodies against type B blood, and if they have type B blood, they will have antibodies against type A blood. This is known as the \"inversely proportional\" relationship between ABO(H) antigens and antibodies.\n* This means that if a person with type A blood receives a transfusion of type B blood, their immune system will recognize the B antigen as foreign and mount an immune response, leading to a severe reaction.\n* The ABO(H) system is the most important because it is the most clinically significant, and a mismatch between the ABO(H) type of the donor and the recipient can lead to a severe hemolytic reaction.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\n* A) The ABO blood group system was not the first to be discovered. The first blood group system to be discovered was the MN blood group system.\n* B) While there are four main ABO blood groups (A, B, AB, and O), this is not the reason why the ABO blood group system is the most important.\n* C) ABO(H) antigens are not",
