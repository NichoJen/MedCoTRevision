6ad1ed6d-5a6c-4192-b5a2-599868352c28,Investigation to distinguish between pregnancy acquired hemophilia A and lupus anticoagulant?,Factor 8 assay,dRVVT,von Willlebrand Factor assay,aPTT,1,single,"In some cases of pregnancy there is antibody formation against the clotting factors, paicularly against factor 8. Dilute Russell's viper venom time- -In-vitro diagnostic test is based on the ability of the venom of the Russell's viper to induce thrombosis. -The venom contains some substances (RVV-V and RVV-X) which directly activate factor V and factor X which turns prothrombin into thrombin in the presence of phospholipid and calcium. -This makes the test sensitive to the presence of lupus anticoagulants, because these antibodies interfere with the clot-promoting role of phospholipid in vitro, and their presence results in a prolonged clotting time. NOTE - the dilute Russell's viper venom test and the hexagonal-phase phospholipids test will be Negative in patients with an acquired inhibitor and Positive in patients with lupus anticoagulants.",Pathology,Bleeding disorder,854,2
a033d327-ee42-4b00-a242-2e3a9d15edcf,Which of the following is an endogenous cellular chemotactic factor?,Prostaglandins,Prostacyclins,Thromboxane,Leukotrienes,3,single,"There are both exogenous and endogenous chemo attractant paicipate in chemotaxis. Exogenous chemotaxins include bacterial oligopeptides of the FMLP type, lectins, denutured proteins, some lipids and lipopolysaccharides. Endogenous chemotaxins are produced by the host organism and are of humoral (complement fragment C5a, C5desArg and Ba, fibrinopeptides, kallikrein and plasminogen activator) or cellular type (from different cells - LTB4, PAF, chemotactic cytokines etc.)",Pathology,,473,1

Oncocytomas are benign tumors characterized by dense accumulation of mitochondria. Oncocytomas occur in kidney, thyroid gland (Hurthle cell tumors), salivary gland and adrenal gland.

d620206f-3962-4547-adcd-f3e36de4c924,Carcinoid tumor develops from-,Enterochromaffin cells,Neuroectoderm,J cells,Goblet cells,0,single,"Ref:Textbook of pathology (Harsh mohan) 6th edition,page no.503 Neuroendocrine tumours of the lung represent a continuum spectrum of lung tumours with progressively increasing aggressiveness which include: typical carcinoid (least aggressive), atypical carcinoid, and large cell endocrine carcinoma, and also small cell carcinoma (most aggressive). All these tumours arise from neuroendocrine (Kulchitsky/Enterochromaffin cells) cells of bronchial mucosa. Formerly, bronchial carcinoids used to be classified as 'bronchial adenomas' but now it is known that they are locally invasive and have the capacity to metastasise. Bronchial carcinoids tend to occur at a younger age than bronchogenic carcinoma, often appearing below the age of 40 years, and are not related to cigarette smoking.",Pathology,Respiratory system,787,2
