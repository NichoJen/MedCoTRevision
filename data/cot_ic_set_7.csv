c2120448-bd3b-4d8f-8963-e92e68ac69e1,"A 36-year-old, alcoholic woman presents with a 1-week history of yellow skin and sclerae. She has suffered persistent headaches. Her vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals jaundice. Laboratory studies disclose markedly elevated levels of AST and ALT (956 and 1,400 U/L, respectively). A few days later, she develops hepatic encephalopathy and renal failure. A liver biopsy shows prominent centrilobular necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acetaminophen toxicity,Fatty liver of pregnancy,Metastatic carcinoma,Reye syndrome,0,single,"Drug toxicity should be suspected in all cases of acute hepatitis. In this case, centrilobular necrosis suggests acetaminophen toxicity. The toxic dose of acetaminophen after a single acute ingestion is in the range of 150mg/kg in children and 7 g in adults. Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine and conjugated in the liver to nontoxic agents, which then are eliminated in the urine. In cases of acute overdose, normal pathways of acetaminophen metabolism become saturated. Excess acetaminophen is then metabolized in the liver via the mixed function oxidase P450 system, yielding oxidative metabolites that cause predictable, hepatocellular necrosis. The centrilobular zones are particularly affected (centrilobular necrosis). Centrilobular necrosis is not seen in the other choices. Reye syndrome (choice D) occurs in children. Fatty liver of pregnancy (choice B) features micro vesicular steatosis.Diagnosis: Acetaminophen toxicity, hepatorenal syndrome",Pathology,Liver & Biliary Tract,990,3
f6a4c9aa-bd3d-4649-83cc-50bc5e1f420e,A wedge shaped area in the adrenal gland is affected. On HPE nucleus is not seen but cellular outlines are intact. Which type of necrosis is being described?,Coagulative,Liquefactive,Fibrinoid,Caseous,0,single,Ans- Coagulative necrosis -Most common type of necrosis seen histologically -A localized area of coagulative necrosis is called an infarct. Ex: - Ischemia to all solid organs except BRAIN. Thermal injury Dry gangrene Zenker's degeneration (muscle necrosis in typhoid fever).,Pathology,Irreversible cell Injury/Necrosis,274,0
4506aae6-1645-42bf-a2fa-3b96ad9c1485,A patient presented with complains of chronic constipation and diarrhoea. There was excessive associated weight loss. Intestinal biopsy was obtained and it showed the following findings. What is your diagnosis?,Giardia,Entamoeba,Whipple's disease,CMV,0,single,Ans. (a) Giardiawww.ncbi.nihgov/pubmed/104699(Ref: )This image shows Giardia lamblia infection of the small intestine. The small pear-shaped trophozoites live in the duodenum and become infective cysts that are excreted. They produce a watery diarrhea. A useful test for diagnosis of infectious diarrheas is stool examination for ova and parasites.,Pathology,G.I.T.,348,0
b54daf8d-e44d-4456-bedd-4e442221c4a3,Blood when stored at 4degC can be kept for ?,7 days,14 days,21 days,28 days,2,single,"Ans. is `c' i.e., 21 days The recommend temperature for storage of blood is 1-6degC. Actually blood can be stored for more than 21 days, depending upon the type of additive used. ""Routine blood storage is limited to 21 days at 1-6degC when treated with acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) or citratephosphate-dextrose (CPD); and 35 days when treated with citrate-phosposphate-dextrose-adenine (CPD-A); and 42 days when treated with saline-adenine-glucose-mannital (SAG-M)"" So, correct answer of this question can be: 21 days (we have only this one in the options) 35 days 42 days (This is the best answer because SAG-M is the routinly used additive these days). Platelets are stored at 20-24degC for 3-5 days",Pathology,,700,2
bf0c51b1-81b2-4ddb-9203-7cce1d129812,Visceral aneurysm is most commonly seen in,Splenic,Renal,Hepatic,Coronary,0,single,"Splenic Aery Aneurysm The splenic aery is a blood vessel that supplies blood to the spleen. The spleen is an organ involved in regulating the immune system. Aneurysms of the splenic aery are the third most common type of aneurysm, but their prevalence is still low. Their overall incidence is about .1 percent. Splenic Aery Aneurysm Risk Factors Splenic aery aneurysms are more common in women than men, and these are also noted to occur in younger patients with an average age of 52 years. Other risk factors include: Lupus Multiple pregnancies Pancreatitis Polyaeritis nodosa Poal hypeension Trauma Splenic Aery Disease Symptoms",Pathology,Cardiovascular system,630,2
