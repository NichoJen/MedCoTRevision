d829e614-e8bf-4652-b316-772630edff79,"About Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, which is wrong?",There is a risk of ventricular tachycardia,Presentation may be with hydrops foetalis,Type a is seen in association with Ebstein's anomaly,Flecainide reduces the recurrence risk of tachycardias,2,single,Wolf-Parkinson-White(WPW) syndrome is a congenital condition resulting from an abnormal connection between the atria and ventricles. The ECG has a sho PR interval. Wide QRS complexes and a delta wave. There are two types: (a) and (b). Type b associated with Ebsteins. Presentation may be with hydrops foetalis or intra-uterine death if there is in-utero tachycardia. Flecanide can be used to stop the tachycardia and to reduce the risk of recurrence of tachycardia.,Pathology,All India exam,465,1
17db0828-b126-41dd-a8d9-28802c614829,Caspases are involved in -,Apoptosis,Pinocytosis,Cell signaling,Cell injury,0,single,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Apoptosis o Caspases and endonuclease cause chromatin fragmentation in apoptosis,o They are inactive, so first they should be activated,o Cytochrome 'c' binds with Apaf-1 and this complex activates caspases.o Caspases cause fragmentation of chromatin and also activate endonuclease.About option 'b'o Though Apaf-1 helps in activation of caspases, it has no role in chromatin fragmentation and It does not have two seprate forms active or inactive. It just forms complex with cytochrome 'C' to activate caspases.Neet Points about Apoptosiso Mitochondrion is the critical organelle required for apoptosis.o Chromatin condensation is the most characteristic feature.o Cell shrinkage is seen.o Gel electrophoresis demonstrates 'step ladder pattern'.o Annexin V is the marker for apoptosis.o CD 95 is the molecular marker for apoptosis.",Pathology,Apoptosis,849,2
c9d9b193-532c-4baa-a97e-837d2625dbcd,ADAMTS13 defeciency is associated with which disease:,ITP,TTP,HUS,PNH,1,single,"The deficiency of ADAMTS13 can be inherited or acquired. In the acquired form, an autoantibody that inhibits the metalloprotease activity of ADAMTS13 is present. Less commonly, patients inherit an inactivating mutation in ADAMTS13. In those with hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency, the onset is often delayed until adolescence and the symptoms are episodic. Thus, factors other than ADAMTS13 (e.g., some superimposed vascular injury or prothrombotic state) must be involved in triggering full-blown TTP. In contrast, HUS is associated with normal levels of ADAMTS13 and is initiated by several other distinct defects Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.",Pathology,,649,2
e4599a75-58ec-466b-992b-9027e51cf631,The most indicative test for prostate cancer is:,A thorough digital rectal examination,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),Excretory urography,Prostate-specific antigen,3,single,"An elevated prostate-specific antigen level indicates prostate cancer, but it can be falsely elevated if done after the prostate gland is manipulated.

Option A: A digital rectal examination should be done as part of the yearly screening, and then the antigen test is done if the digital exam suggests cancer.
Option B: MRI is used in staging the cancer.",Pathology,,354,1
