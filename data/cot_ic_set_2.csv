What is the likely diagnosis?",Candidiasis,Herpes,CMV,Eosinophilic Esophagitis,2,single,"Pizza Pie Appearance of Retina on fundoscopy in an HIV infected patient suggests probable diagnosis of CMV Retinitis. The Histolpathological slide from the Upper GI Endoscopy biospy specimen shows presence of large (cytomegalic) cells with Owl&;s eye appearance. This appearance is typical of CMV infection. Pizza Pie Appearance of Retina on fundoscopy in an HIV infected patient suggests CMV Cytomegalovirus retinitis is the single most common oppounistic ocular infection seen in immunocompromised patients including those affected with HIV CMV retinitis in HIV patients is characterized by haemorrhage and necrosis in a perivascular distribution, with loss of fundal details, giving it the classical &;Pizza Pie&; Appearance This appearance is also termed as ""Cheese and ketchup"" appearance. Owl&;s eye Appearance from Intranuclear Inclusions in Biopsy Specimen suggests CMV infection Cells infected with CMV are two to four times larger than surrounding cells (cytomegalic) in vivo and often contain an 8- to 10- micromts intranuclear basophilic (or amphophilic ) inclusion body that is eccentrically placed and is surrounded by a clear peripheral halo, producing an ""owl eye"" appearance (sometimes called Bull&;s eye appearance) Smaller inclusions may also be demostrated in the cytoplasm occasionally (Typically basophillic and smaller) Cytomegalic cells are found in a wide variety of organs, including the salivary glands, lung, liver, kidney, intestine, pancreas, adrenal gland and central nervous system. Virus Inclusion Description Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Cowdry type A Intranuclear Basophilic (or Amphophilic) inclusions surrounded by a halo and by marginated chromatin Intracytoplasmic Inclusions consists of clusters of small granular basophilic bodies of various sizes Ref: Harrison&;s 19th edition Pgno: 1191",Pathology,dermatology and infectious disease,1822,3
0c381920-1397-4043-ad88-f9686c751d52,Which is the BEST site for taking biopsy in a case of viral oesophagitis?,Edge of ulcer,Base of ulcer,Adjacent indurated area around ulcer,Surrounding normal mucosa,0,single,"The best place to take biopsy is from within the the squamous mucosa at the edges of the ulcer and in sloughed cells within the exudate. HSV esophagitis: Esophagus is the most common site of GI herpes infection. HSV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia and AIDS, transplant recipients and burn victims. It commonly involves the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Microscopically, the characteristic feature of herpetic infection occur in the squamous epithelium at the margin of the ulcers or erosions. The 2 types of viral inclusions present in HSV infection are: homogenous or smudge cells and acidophilic inclusions with a surrounding clear halo and peripheral chromatin migration(Cowdry type A).

0593c2e0-741a-4350-a5ab-1a610056af6a,"A 16-year-old girl has had frequent nosebleeds since childhood. Her gums bleed easily, even with routine tooth brushing. She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Glanzmann thrombasthenia,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura,Vitamin C deficiency,1,single,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.",Pathology,Blood,865,3
7171551c-b444-47dc-9ee4-de6fd0a4d928,Nearly 20% of normal tensile strength of tissue at the site of wound is gained after: September 2008,1 week of wound healing,2 weeks of wound healing,3 weeks of wound healing,4 weeks of wound healing,2,single,"Ans. C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.",Pathology,,1008,3
