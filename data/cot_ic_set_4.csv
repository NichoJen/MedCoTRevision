These cells are considered to be terminally differentiated and non proliferative in postnatal life. This includes brain cells, neurons, hea cells, skeletal muscle cells, and red blood cells.Although these cells are considered permanent in that they neither reproduce nor transform into other cells, this does not mean that the body can not create new versions of these cells. For instance, structures in the bone marrow produce new red blood cells constantly, while skeletal muscle damage can be repaired by underlying satellite cells which fuse to become a new skeletal muscle cell.nenrons are examples of permanent cells ..these cells cannot divide in the post natal life Ref Robbins 9/e refer the chapter inflammation and repair .",Pathology,General pathology,795,2
9d58590d-90af-4a7d-8867-da7f7fb14d08,A 50 year old man presents at an emergency room because of several hours of progressively increasing chest pain that no longer responds to sublingual nitroglycerin. This type of angina is thought to be due to which of the following conditions?,Atherosclerosis alone,Coronary aery embolism,Coronary aery spasm,Thrombosis with or without underlying atherosclerosis,3,single,"The patient has unstable or crescendo angina, which is thought to be due to a slowly developing thrombosis in a coronary aery branch. The thrombosis may or may not occur over an area of the vessel involved by atherosclerotic plaque. Thrombolytic agents are paicularly helpful in this type of patient. Atherosclerosis alone usually causes stable angina occurring with exeion. Coronary aery embolism is uncommon, but can occur if a plaque at the aoic orifice fragments and is driven into a coronary aery. Coronary aery spasm is thought to cause angina at rest (Prinzmetal's angina). This type of angina is typically severe, but does not have a crescendo pattern, and often occurs in younger patients.

379dd9ca-12ef-41e9-bf5b-c1e29171da32,Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) differs from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. In this reference the DIC is most likely characterized by-,Significant numbers of schistocytes,A brisk reticulocytosis,Decreased coagulation factor levels,Significant thrombocytopenia,2,single,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Decreased coagulation factor levels DIC is characterized by excessive activation of the coagulation system. That leads to formation of microthrombi throughout the microcirculation of the body, often in a quixotically even distribution. o As a consequence of the thrombotic diathesis, there is consumption of platelets, fibrin and coagulation factors_and secondary activation of fibrinolytic mechanism. o Thus DIC can present with signs and symptoms relating to tissue hypoxia and infarction caused by the myriad microthrombi or as a hemorrhagic disorder related to depletion of elements required for homeostasis, hence the term consumption coagulopathy is used to describe D.I.C. o DIC can also lead to hemolytic anemia. It occurs due to fragmentation of red cells as they try to squeeze through the narrowed microvasculature. Schistocytes, the cells characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are quiet common in patients with D. I.0 (seen in 50%) of cause. o Like D.I.C., TT.P too, is characterized by widespread thrombosis and similar to D.I.C, the disseminated thrombosis leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. But the point to emphasize is that in TT.P the thrombus is a platelet thrombi i.e. the thrombi is composed mainly of platelets aggregates so quite unlike D.I.C. the level of coagulation factors remain normal. Robbins' States ""While D.I.C. and thrombotic microangiopathies share features such as microvascular occlusion and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, they are pathogenetically distinct. In T. and HUS (unlike DIC), activation of the coagulation cascade is not of primary impoant, and hence results of laboratory tests of coagulation such as PT and PTT are usually normal.""",Pathology,,1726,3
